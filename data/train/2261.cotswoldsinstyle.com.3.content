Situated in the village of Oakridge Lynch, on the south facing hills overlooking the Golden Valley, Well Close Cottage is a luxurious, warm and inviting retreat away from the stresses of modern life.

Oakridge Lynch is situated in the heart of the Stroud valleys, a beautiful and undiscovered part of the Cotswolds. The area offers excellent walking, superb views and some of the most charming villages to be found anywhere in England.

Oakridge is well known locally for its maze of small winding footpaths and the fact that there are no street names. The cottage is situated on the village green off a single track road. The only traffic is vehicles accessing the few properties around the green. <a href="wcc.htm">Well Close Cottage</a>
