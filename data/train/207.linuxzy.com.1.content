		<p>You know that more and more people, especially those who are trying to run their own business both online and offline, are seriously paying more attention to learn about search engine optimisation as one of the kick-ass marketing skills to have. However, to most of them search engine optimisation (AKA: SEO) is like magic as they simply cannot understand how it all works and what it takes to rank their own sites to the top page of Google or other major search engines for their targeted keyword phrases.</p>
<p>Well, it is true that SEO involves a lot of technical understanding especially <a title="search algorithms" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_algorithm" target="_blank">search algorithms</a>, which unfortunately keep changing all the time so whatever you learned about the algorithms 3 months ago might be obsolete today. Yet nobody from Google or any other search engines would come out and teach us which part of SE algorithms changes and how to deal with it&#8230; All the SEO experts wish that is something those big SE companies do but they just do not in order to prevent any SEO guys from manipulating the new algorithms so that they can rank even not so quality websites pretty much at their will.</p>
<p>So really the only way to keep up with their algorithm updates is to keep testing with a bunch of test websites by applying different ideas and techniques you may come up with or what you have learned from some other SEO people online, then monitor the results regularly so that you can see how their algorithms move your site up and down depending on the techniques and tactics you have implemented to your test sites.</p>
<p>This, however, takes a lot of time and ongoing efforts on your part so unless you are absolutely dedicated to the field of SEO or have a team of similar minded people doing that to help each other, it would be quite a difficult task to accomplish. If that is the case you may want to start looking into hiring professional SEO services instead.<br />

If you happened to be a local business owner in Perth, you should start seeking to find a <a title="reputable SEO company" href="http://www.webitrix.com/seo-perth.html" target="_blank">reputable SEO company</a>. There quite a few of them out there but if they can give you a personalised proposal instead of a cookie-cutter one, they maybe a good candidate for a shortlist. But one thing you need to do before even getting into SEO is having your own website that converts site visitors into leads or paid customers for whatever you are offering in your business. If not, all the traffic generated by SEO would be wasted. So if you do not have one like that, you may also need to find a good website design company in your area. If you are in Perth, you may want to check out <a title="Webitrix website design Rockingham" href="http://www.webitrix.com/website-design-rockingham.html" target="_blank">Webitrix &#8211; Website Design Rockingham</a> as they are very good with building a simple and effective websites that convert.</p>
<p>Remember, at the end of the day you must focus on two things to get your SEO campaign running successfully, one is conversion and the other one is targeted traffic. Good luck!</p>
