            	<div class="secondFloor scroll font_11 lightBlue">LOAN AGREEMENT<br>
By cashing and/or endorsing a 0% MyCashAccess check (the “Check”), and in consideration of the receipt of the funds represented by the Check, I hereby agree to the following:<br><br>

1. The Debt.  The money I receive from cashing the Check is a debt that must be repaid to MyCashAccess a division of Stone Street Capital, LLC, or its successors and assigns ("MyCashAccess"), and I agree to repay the face amount of the Check, together with such other costs incurred by MyCashAccess as a result of a default described in Section 4 below (collectively, the "Debt") pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. 

<br><br>2. Repayment of the Debt. On the fifth (5th) day following the next periodic payment due to me (the "Maturity Date"), I shall repay to MyCashAccess or its assigns the entire Debt. I represent and warrant that my next periodic payment is (a) due and payable within 12 months from the date I cash the Check, and (b) available and sufficient to repay the Debt in full. I understand that I have the right to prepay the Debt due hereunder, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, without penalty or premium. All partial prepayments shall be applied to the Debt's principal. 

<br><br>3. Representations and Warranties. I hereby represent and warrant that: (a) I am a recipient of a U.S. state lottery prize, a casino jackpot prize, a corporate game prize or similar prize or annuity entitling me to annual or more frequent Periodic Payments (either directly in payments made to me, or thru an entity, such as a trust or partnership, in which I have an interest) (collectively, "Periodic Payments"); (b) I have good and marketable and unencumbered title in and to all of the Collateral (defined in Section 8 below), free and clear of any security interests, liens, pledges, charges, encumbrances, equities and claims, other than those created under this Loan Agreement (this "Agreement"); and (c) I have the right, power, and authority to enter into this Agreement and to grant the security interest in the Collateral created herein. 

<br><br>4. Default. In the event that the Debt is not paid to MyCashAccess in full on or before the Maturity Date, I understand that I will be in default under this Agreement. In addition, I understand that the following events shall also be deemed to be a default by me under the terms of this Agreement: (a) my death; (b) my insolvency or the appointment of a custodian, trustee, liquidator or receiver for me or my assets; (c) the filing of a petition under bankruptcy, insolvency or debtor's relief laws by or against me; (d) if I admit, in writing, my inability to pay my debts as they come due; (e) if I grant an interest in my Periodic Payments to any third party without MyCashAccess's consent; or (f) I fail to comply with any term or provision of this Agreement.

<br><br>5. Remedies upon Default. I understand that in the event I fail to make payment of the Debt when due, or if I am otherwise in default as provided in Section 4, above, the unpaid principal of the Debt shall bear interest from the date of default at the rate of eighteen percent (18%) per annum or, if less, the highest rate then allowed by the applicable law, until the Debt is paid in full. Upon a default hereunder, I also promise to pay all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred in the collection of the Debt. I further agree that MyCashAccess shall have all other rights of a secured creditor to collect the Debt and attach and sell the Collateral and that MyCashAccess may, to the extent allowable under applicable law, collect by legal proceedings or otherwise all payments, and other sums now or hereafter payable on account of the Collateral, and hold the same as additional Collateral, or apply the same to any of the Debt. I agree that I will provide reasonable assistance in MyCashAccess's efforts to obtain approval of any such assignment that may be required by any court, or other entity. I understand that the rights and remedies of MyCashAccess as provided in this Agreement and under any applicable laws, including, but not limited to, the Uniform Commercial Code, shall be cumulative and may be pursued singly, successively or together against me and/or the Collateral. I further understand that the failure to exercise any such right or remedy shall not be deemed a waiver or release of such rights or remedies or the right to exercise any of them at any other time(s). 

<br><br>6. Waiver of Demand, Presentment, Notice and Protest. I hereby waive demand, presentment, notice of nonpayment and protest, and I assent to any extensions of time of payment, or forbearance or other indulgences, without notice. 

<br><br>7. Grant of Security Interest. In connection with the rights granted to MyCashAccess hereunder and to secure my obligations to repay the Debt, I hereby grant to MyCashAccess a security interest in all of my right, title and interest in and right to receive all of the Collateral, as defined in Section 8, to the extent permissible under applicable laws. I hereby authorize MyCashAccess to perfect the security interest granted in the Collateral pursuant to this Agreement, including, without limitation, by the filing of UCC-l financing statements. I agree that such UCC-1 may also serve as notice of other rights granted to MyCashAccess under the Agreement. I agree that I will notify MyCashAccess of any change in my address so that MyCashAccess can file additional UCC-1 financing statements, as appropriate. I agree not to grant an interest in the Collateral to any third party and that I will not permit any subsequent financing statements to be filed by one or more third parties against all or any portion of the Collateral. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, if I fail to make any payment due under this Agreement, MyCashAccess may foreclose only on that portion of the Collateral sufficient to satisfy the Debt and such other amounts due pursuant to Section 5 above. 
<br><br>8. Collateral. To the extent permissible under applicable law, the property which is subject to the security interest created hereby consists of the following: (a) all right, title and interest in and to the Periodic Payments; (b) all accounts, contracts rights, intangibles, instruments, monies, payments, products, proceeds and other rights arising out of a sale, lease or other disposition of any or all of the Periodic Payments, and (c) if my interest in the Periodic Payments is thru an entity, my entire interest in such entity (collectively (a) through (c) are referred to as the "Collateral"). 

<br><br>9. Power of Attorney; Further Assurances. I hereby grant a power of attorney and appoint MyCashAccess as my attorney in fact, in my name, place and stead, to endorse any check or execute any document in connection with its efforts to collect the Debt or to realize upon or protect the Collateral.  This power of attorney is deemed coupled with an interest and shall survive my death, insolvency or bankruptcy.  At any time and from time to time, upon request by MyCashAccess and without further consideration, I shall take such actions or cause others to do so, and shall execute, acknowledge and deliver, or cause to be executed, acknowledged and delivered, all transfers, conveyances, instruments, powers of attorney and assurances, as may reasonably be required or desirable for better securing MyCashAccess in the Collateral or, in the event of default or breach by me hereunder, to convey, transfer and/or assign the Collateral to MyCashAccess for the purpose of satisfying my obligations arising from this Agreement.
<br><br>10. Right of First Refusal. In consideration for the Check and the terms of repayment of such loan, I agree that I will not sell, borrow against or otherwise transfer or encumber all or any portion of my Periodic Payments without notifying MyCashAccess and otherwise complying with the provisions of this Agreement. If a third party makes an offer to me to purchase, assign, lend against or otherwise take an interest in any portion of the Periodic Payments (an "Offer"), then prior to accepting such Offer, I agree that: (a) I will immediately notify MyCashAccess that I have received an Offer; (b) I will provide MyCashAccess with the identity of the offeror, and a written copy of the Offer on the offeror's letterhead (regardless of the original form of the Offer) containing the specifics of the Offer; (c) MyCashAccess shall then have the right to elect in writing to purchase the portion of the Periodic Payments to which the Offer is made on the same or better terms (which shall be determined in my reasonable discretion) specified in such Offer, by providing me with written notice of MyCashAccess's offer, within three (3) business days after MyCashAccess receives the Offer; (d) In the event that MyCashAccess elects to match or beat the Offer, then within five (5) days, I agree to execute a contract and all other documents including court pleadings, necessary to consummate the transaction with MyCashAccess; and (e) the rights granted under this Section 10 to MyCashAccess shall survive the repayment of the Debt and other obligations due under this Agreement and shall expire at the end of five (5) years from the date the Check is cashed.
 
<br><br>11. Governing Law.  I agree that this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws, and not the laws of conflict, of the state of my residence at the time I enter into this Agreement. 

<br><br>12. Severability. I agree that if any part of this Agreement shall be judged invalid or not enforceable by any court, then such partial invalidity or unenforceability shall not cause the remainder of this Agreement to be or to become invalid or unenforceable, and if a provision hereof is held invalid or unenforceable in one or more of its applications, I agree that said provision shall remain in effect in all valid or enforceable applications that are severable from the invalid or unenforceable application or applications.
<br><br>13. Amendment/Waiver/Assignment. 

No amendment to or waiver of any rights under this Agreement shall be valid unless done in writing and signed by both me and MyCashAccess. The rights and obligations under this Agreement may not be assigned, except that MyCashAccess may assign its rights and obligations hereunder. 

<br><br>14. Rescission. I understand that I have a right to rescind this Agreement and all rights granted to MyCashAccess hereunder, provided that within three (3) business days after the cashing of the Check, I mail a certified check or money order to MyCashAccess in the amount of the Check, together with a letter from me terminating this Agreement.

<br><br>15. Notice. Any notice given in accordance with this Agreement shall be in writing and shall deemed effectively delivered in all respects (a) when received, if manually delivered, or (b) two (2) days after deposit in a U.S. Post Office and directed to the intended addressee by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid. Any such notice to me shall be directed to me at the address to which the Check was mailed, or at such other place as I shall direct by written notice to MyCashAccess. Any notice to MyCashAccess shall be directed to MyCashAccess at 7316 Wisconsin Avenue, Suite 500, Bethesda, MD 20814, attn: Lottery Processing, or at such other place as MyCashAccess shall direct by written notice to me.
