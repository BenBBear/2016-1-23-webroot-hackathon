<p>I've been away for a while, but there's nothing that gets the blogging juices flowing again like another example of Spanish ignorance
and racism, or in this case that of their Argentinian cousins. </p>

<p>This is an incident that occurred back in August of 2008, during the Olympics, but I don't think it got much notice. I just accidentally
came across it recently. </p>

<p>I had written about the <a href="http://www.solitaryone.com/?page=articles/2008/08/20080813">Spanish men's national 
basketball team making slant-eye gestures</a> back in August of 2008. (It was, as a matter of fact, my first post on this blog.) Then
there was the <a href="http://www.solitaryone.com/?page=articles/2008/08/20080815">Spanish Federation cup team doing the same.</a> 
Not to be outdone by the athletes, the <a href="http://www.solitaryone.com/?page=articles/2008/10/20081030">Spanish F1 racing 
fans decided to get in on the racist act</a>. Now, granted they're not Spanish, but the former Spanish colony of Argentina is displaying
it's affinity for the old country. Is there a cultural pattern emerging here? </p>

<p>With no need to restate all the comments I've made regarding this topic, but simply to state the facts with regards to this particular
incident: Members of the Argentinian women's soccer (football) team, Maria Potassa, Eva Gonzalez, Fabiana Vallejos and Andrea Ojeda,
were photographed making the slant-eye gesture that is used to mock Asians. The photo was published in a South American sports newspaper
Ole days before the 2008 Beijing Olympics. The details can be found in this <a href="http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/World-News/Argentinian-Womens-Football-Team-Make-Slant-Eyed-Gestures-In-Olympic-Photograph/Article/200808315082256"
target="_blank">Sky News article</a>. </p>

<p>As a further sign of the extent of this problem, John Terry, the captain of the English team has said that he will lead his
team off the field in support, if the referee decided to take action against Spanish fans' racism in their upcomming Wednesday match. This after their experience
during a 2004 friendly against Spain when fans directed racist chants at Shaun Wright-Phillips and Ashley Cole. You can read the full
details in this <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/international/england/4583436/England-vow-to-stand-up-to-racist-chants.html" target="_blank">
Telegraph article</a>. </p>

<p>Whether there's an undercurrent of racism in Spanish culture, as well as numerous others, there are too many examples of these types
of racist incidents involving Spanish athletes and fans for them to be isolated incidents or outliers. There have been numerous articles
that have argued that Spanish society seems more tolerant of these expressions of racism in sports, since similar situations are not as commonly seen
in other European countries. </p>

<p>Regardless, apparently racist behavior by the Spanish were not seen as isolated incidents since there were people that
found enough objectionable behavior by their athletes to have started a Facebook campaign to have Spain kicked out of the 2008 summer Olympics in Beijing. </p>  

<p>As usual, their defense (in this case Spain's Olympic tennis silver-medallist Anabel Medina Garrigues) was that they didn't see
it as a racist gesture. This is what is always said in defense of people who've caused offense, yet they never seem to be able to
grasp the concept that the offenders' intentions isn't the issue, but the consequences of their actions. A drunk driver doesn't
intend to kill someone while driving drunk, but that's of no relevance to the victim. </p>

<p class="headline">Minority Status: Defined Externally vs. Internally</p>

<!-- <p class="floatleft"> </p> -->

<p>Very often in debates about racism, discrimination, affirmative action, etc., you will hear white ethnics (that's the technical term used in 
sociology, I believe) who don't understand complaints from minorities, express the belief that they are simply complaining and trying to 
find excuses, or gain an unfair advantage. The standard line is that when their ancestors immigrated to the United States from Ireland, Italy, etc.,
they were discriminated against, but they managed to pull themselves up by the bootstraps and integrate into society to achieve the American dream.</p>

<p>The problem with this view is that it shows a lack of understanding, or willful ignorance, of the basis of discrimination in American society.
Many don't want to face the fact that the discrimination in this society is based on culture, and more exclusively, race. </p>

<p>While it is true that many European immigrants faced discrimination during certain times in this country's history, that discrimination was based
on culture. Once these immigrants assimilated into American culture, that discrimination essentially went away. When the children of those immigrants were born
in America, and grew up speaking English without an accent and adopted American culture, they essentially became full-fledge members of the white-majority
club. In the early part of the century, there might have been some discrimination based on someone's European ethnicity, but that was temporary and has long faded.</p>

<p>The main basis for discrimination in this country is based on race. One example to illustrate this point is that of the father of actor David Boreanaz, of <i>Bones</i>
and <i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i> fame. According to David, when his father was hired for a Buffalo, New York TV station, he used the name Dave Thomas, as
opposed to his real name, because the station felt his real name was too "ethnic" (e.g. too Italian). The point of this story is that, as long as he was white, 
it didn't matter what his ethnic background was, since that was something that can be easily covered up. </p>

<p>On the other hand, during the historical 2008 U.S. presidential election, many voters, while being interviewed, said plainly that they could not
vote for someone with the name Barack Hussein Obama for president. I venture to guess that these people were not being completely honest (perhaps even to themselves). 
Even if Obama was named Lastings Milton Abercrombie, these people still would not have voted for him. They would still have voted for McCain, even if 
he had been born Vladimir Muhammad Chen Rodrigo. </p>

<p>The core sociological idea behind this is that, for white ethnics, identity is largely self-defined, especially given the prevalent miscegenation between white ethnics.
Therefore, for someone with Irish, German, Italian, Scottish and Greek ancestry, they can decide, somewhat arbitrarily, whether they want to define themselves as
Irish-American, Italian-American, etc. For racial minorities on the other hand, how they can be defined is written all over their faces. To wit, for white ethnics, minority
status is internally defined (not to mention irrelevant and superficial, i.e. of no social consequence), while that for racial minorities, it is externally defined and has an
effect on their opportunities and options.</p>  

<p>For many generations now, being of Jewish, Italian or Irish, etc., decent has not had any effect on a person's ability to rise to the highest positions in society, as too many
examples to cite unequivocally demonstrate. For racial minorities on the other hand, this is not the case. Although the election of Obama is a great step in the right direction,
an argument to the contrary using the result of the election, would be based on specious evidence. </p>

<p>This leads me to the last point, which is that of using some (white) ethnicity to try and claim minority status, or to deny that status to racial minorities. An example of this is
that of Jewish identity. Without commenting too much on this topic, lest I incur the wrath of the Anti-Defamation League, I will just say that the vast majority of Jews, being Jewish
in no way results in any discrimination (no more than to someone who is, for example, too short/fat/tall/etc.), as evidenced by the success many have achieved. No aspect of their daily lives
differs in any degree from that of any other white person in mainstream American society. The extremely high levels of amalgamation, often used by sociologists as a measure of integration, between Jews and white non-Jews,
is another indicator of how inextricable they are from white, mainstream society. So any attempt to claim minority status (and I am not claiming that most do, although some groups have, and done so very
successfully), would be, to some extent, self-delusional (or self-defined, i.e. not definited by society), thus making it hard for many on the outside to see what really distinguishes them from mainstream white America. 
(One exception that might have to be made is that of Orthodox Jews, who differ culturally, to a certain extent, from white mainstream society.) </p>

<p>I will simply quote Edgar Bronfman, Sr., who I think spoke in an incredibly insightful and forthright manner when he made the following comments in a
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/05/magazine/05wwln-q4-t.html?ref=magazine" target="_blank">New York Times article</a>:</p>

<p><b>Why is it important to you that Judaism continues? </b>
There are things we have to do. For instance, Darfur, Cambodia, Rwanda. There have been holocausts since our Holocaust. We should be the first people to stand up and say this is unacceptable, 
but we don't. We say, "Never again," just for us. We have to say, No, it's for everyone, this "Never again."

<p><b>Why do you give your money to Jewish causes instead of broader social causes?</b>
There are not that many of us in the Jewish world who understand that we are in crisis. We are not in crisis because 
of anti-Semitism; we are in crisis because we are disappearing through assimilation. </p>

<p><b>How do you know that anti-Semitism is no longer a threat? </b>
I think the greatest evidence of that is when Al Gore lost but didn't lose the election in 2000, nobody blamed it on Joe Lieberman 
because Joe was a Jew. Nobody. I never heard that. </p>

<p>Others notable Jews, such as Noam Chomsky and Norman Finkelstein, have expressed similar views on Jewish identity, history, etc., and as a result, come under attack
from the ADL, Alan Dershowitz, and other like-minded individuals. </p>

<p class="headline">A 146-year-old Civil War Continues: Some Southerners Cannot Accept Black President, Enhancing Calls for Secession</p>

<p>After the historic election of the first African-American president of the United States, white supremacist groups and hate crimes are on the rise.</p>

<p class="floatleft"><img src="http://www.solitaryone.com/images/articles/2008/11/confederate-soldiers.jpg" alt="Photograph of Confederate soldiers." 
title="Photograph of Confederate soldiers." /> </p>

<p>On November 12, I wrote about the negative reactions from a number of European politicians and journalists to the U.S. election. Not to be outdone, racists 
in the U.S. are stepping up their activities because they cannot accept having a black president. (I supported Obama for president because I think he will take the
country in a better direction than McCain. But if for no other reason, I'm glad that he won because of the satisfaction I get in knowning that all those racists out 
there are bugging out, as a result of having to deal with the fact that the new president of the country they live in is a black man.) </p>

<p><a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/1117/p03s01-uspo.html" target="_blank">As reported in the Christian Science Monitor</a>,
hate crime incidents have spiked, and hate language has increased, since the election of Barack Obama as the 44th president of the United States. </p>

<p>The article reports that white supremacist and nationalist websites have seen a dramatic increase in hits: Stormfront and the Council of Conservative Citizens report 
that their servers have crashed because of heavy traffic. The League of the South, a secessionist group, says Web hits jumped from 50,000 a month to 300,000 since Nov. 4, 
and its phones are ringing off the hook. </p>

<p>The article points out that a there is a segment of this society that feels disenfranchised and politically marginalized, and that this, in part, is the cause for this
up tick in hate activity and language. Reports have also shown a dramatic increase in gun sales as a result of the election, such as 
<a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=6209255" target="_blank">this one from ABC News</a>. These white people who feel so marginalized and disenfranchised in America, 
at least some of them, must live with so much fear, and completely lack a sense of self-esteem and security. This is pathetic since whites inherently enter society facing
the fewest obstacles, at least on a racial level&#8212;which is often, though not always, correlated to a person's economic level.   

<p>Often, people in this country and in other places look at conflicts in the Middle East disdainfully, wondering how people could engage in sectarian violence over 
events and grudges from over one thousand years ago. Maybe as the old adage goes, they should take a look in the mirror. Even though the American Civil War has been 
technically over for over 140 years, there are still many who have not gotten over it. There are still active groups in this country who are still seeking secession
from the United States of America. These sentiments have also increase as a result of this historic election. There are still people who have not gotten over the idea
that slavery is wrong, though I'm sure they would not put it in those terms, even to themselves. More often, they portray it as a respect for "tradition," which is one
of those insidious code words, describing a longing for the good ol' days of, if not slavery, at least Jim Crow or segregation. </p>

<p>Unfortunately for those whites who feel threatened by the changing nature of American demographics, and see the political influence of the Deep South and the 
"Southern strategy" fading, time's tide is not on their side. As population projections show, in another generation or two, whites will become a minority in the U.S.
And to those whites who cannot accept the future and let go and move beyond their vision of the past, time's tide will smother you, and I will too. </p>  

<p>Here is just a small article roll of the anti-black and anti-Muslim (even though Obama has been a Christian his whole life) reactions against the election results:
<blockquote>
&#149; <a href="http://rawstory.com/rawreplay/?p=2451" target="_blank">Obama election "is sin against the Lord" because we have a &nbsp;&nbsp;"Muslim" president</a> <br />
&#149; <a href="http://rawstory.com/rawreplay/?p=2436" target="_blank">Lawsuits claim election night hate crimes by Chicago police</a> <br />
&#149; <a href="http://wcbstv.com/local/obama.bias.crime.2.858391.html" target="_blank">Cross burned on lawn of N.J. Obama Supporter</a> <br />
&#149; <a href="http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2008/11/staten_island_teen_gang_beat_m.html" target="_blank">Staten Island teen beaten while attackers shout 'Obama'</a> <br />
&#149; <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/CRIME/10/27/obama.plot/" target="_blank">Tennessee men charged with plot to kill Obama</a> <br />
</blockquote> 
</p>

<p>The list is nowhere near exhaustive, and I'm sure is only a miniscule fraction of all the election-related hate crimes that have been committed as a result of the
election result. I certainly have come across too many reports to list here. </p>

<p class="headline">This Is The Real You: European Politicians React To U.S. Election, Revealing Racist Attitudes</p>

<p>Many politicians and ordinary people in Europe, as well as around the world, reacted positively and enthusiastically to the election of Barack Obama as the 
next president of the United State of America. This was the image that most Americans saw when broadcasts showed the reactions of people from around the world to
the 2008 U.S. presidential election. </p>

<p><img src="http://www.solitaryone.com/images/articles/2008/11/HitlerMussolini.jpg" width="486.864" height="291.2168" alt="Hitler and Mussolini" title="Hitler and Mussolini"> <br />
<span class="body7">Austrian Journalist Klaus Emmerich called Obama dangerous and implicitly compared him to Hitler.</span></p>

<p>However, what we weren't shown was the other side, those who reacted with racist remarks that reveal the attitude still held by many in Europe, the root of which
is a sense of white superiority and entitlement. </p>

<p>There are many aspects of Europe which is admirable, including scientific, cultural and social developments of the highest order. Many of their ideals are the 
most progressive in the world, especially those dealing with equality and democracy. Europe is one of the most democratic and free places on earth, with some of
the highest living standards (based on per capita GDP). However, the sense of superiority and entitlement is also another aspect of European culture, and they cannot
be allowed to be selective in which parts of their culture they want to accept and which parts they want to deny. </p>

<p>Despite these achievements, it should not cover up the fact that some aspects of European society have not lived up to these high ideals. Rumsfeld spoke about
"old and new Europe." He was referring to something else, but the terms can also be borrowed to describe racial attitudes in Europe. Racism is still prevalent,
as recognized by France's first lady, when she spoke about the election, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/12/world/europe/12europe.html?hp" target="_blank">
as reported in a NYTimes.com article</a>: 
<blockquote>
"The election of Barack Obama highlights via a cruel contrast the shortcomings of the French Republic and the distance that separates us from a country whose citizens 
knew how to go beyond the racial question," the manifesto said. It won support from Mr. Sarkozy's wife, Carla, who told Le Journal du Dimanche, "our prejudices are 
insidious" and hoped the "Obama effect" would help to reshape society.
</blockquote>
In another example, Britain has only 15 nonwhites in the 646-member House of Commons. </p>

<p>(The manifesto was in reference to one written by Yazid Sabeg of France, a millionaire child of Algerian immigrants, calling for affirmative-action programs to 
help realize the French ideal of equality in French society.) </p> 

<p>Here is just a sampling of some of the reactions of "old Europe" (as reported <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/11/10/AR2008111002810.html"
target="_blank">in this WashingtonPost.com article</a>):
<blockquote><u>Silvio Berlusconi, prime minister of Italy</u>: On Thursday, during a visit to Moscow, he praised Obama for being "young, handsome and even suntanned." Berlusconi's remark 
caused a stir in Italy, as critics chided him for sounding like a fool. But the prime minister was unrepentant. "What's the problem? It was a compliment," 
he told journalists the next day. Anyone who did not get the joke, he added, was an "imbecile." <br /> <br />

<u>National Democratic Party of Germany (neo-Nazi sympathizers)</u>: "Africa Conquers the White House," read a headline on their Web site. J&#252;rgen Gansel, a party 
leader and an elected lawmaker in the German state of Saxony, blamed Obama's victory on "the American alliance of Jews and Negroes." <br /> <br />

<u>Die Tageszeitung, a Berlin newspaper</u>: It published a large front-page photo of the White House under the headline, "Uncle Barack's Cabin." <br /> <br />

<u>Klaus Emmerich, well-known Austrian journalist</u>: "I think the Americans are still racists and they must be very badly off to so spectacularly -- and that has to be said, no doubt -- 
send a black man with a black, very good-looking and clever woman to the White House." After saying that he "wouldn't want the Western world to be directed by a black man," 
he added: "If you say that is a racist comment, you're right. Without a doubt." (At least he's honest about his racism; I salute him for that.) <br /> <br />

<u>Artur G&#243;rski, legislator from the Law and Justice party of Poland</u>: Obama is "the black messiah of the new Left" and a "crypto-communist" who would undoubtedly 
prove a "disaster." He added: "Al-Qaeda is rubbing their hands with glee that the new president wants peace, not war.... This marks the end of the white man's civilization.... 
America will soon pay a high price for this quirk of democracy."

<p class="dateline">Saturday, November 1, 2008</p>
      
<p class="headline">UPDATE: Step Aside Hitler's Germans, Here Come the Spanish F1 Fans (And an NY Ad Agency)!</p>

<p>As I wrote about in my October 30, 2008, post, a Web site was set up in Spain on which there were numerous posts filled with abusive and racist language 
directed at McLaren F1 driver Lewis Hamilton.</p>

<p>As an update, it turns out that the site was owned by the Spanish subsidiary of the New York-based advertising agency TWBA, a part of Omnicom, one of the largest
advertising agencies in the world. This was according to a report in <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/motorsport/formulaone/3362526/Website-at-the-centre-of-racist-attacks-on-Lewis-Hamilton-is-owned-by-the-worlds-biggest-advertising-agency.html"
target="_blank">The Daily Telegraph</a>. </p>

<p>The degree to which the employees and management of the company were aware of what was being posted on their Web site, and the extent of their responsibility, 
can be open to further investigation and debated. A spokesperson in New York could not explain why the site was not monitored for racist and abusive content. 
What should be noted is that this type of racism can be easily, openly and publicly broadcasted on space owned and operated by a major corporation.  </p>

<p>Though no one who has a clear view of society should be surprised that such things exist, we should also not be surprised that there are those out there who
feel free to use a site belonging to an international corporation to post these  types of thoughts and views. What could be really worthwhile to consider, especially 
by people who are surprised by this incident, is a re-evaluation of the state of society, to gain a more realistic view of it. This way they can see how it is a society 
where these people feel perfectly comfortable in using a mainstream Web site to openly put up such posts, and one in which the owners did not feel the need to be vigilant 
and on the alert for such an occurrence. </p>

<p>In other words, despite a lot of lip service, racism is still not a very important issue in a lot of societies, not a subject worth being aware of. </p>

<p class="dateline">Thursday, October 30, 2008</p>
      
<p class="headline">Step Aside Hitler's Germans, Here Come the Spanish F1 Fans!</p>

<p>A Web site that has been set up in Spain against McLaren F1 driver Lewis Hamilton is filled with racist language.</p>

<p class="floatleft"><img src="http://www.solitaryone.com/images/articles/2008/10/MoorRacer.png" alt="Racist F1 fans; Moorish racer in Spain" 
title="Racist F1 fans; Moorish racer in Spain" /> <br /><span class="body8">A Moor in Spain</span></p>

<p>First let's get some things out of the way. All people are racist. If you are human, then you are racist (or "clannist," or nationalist, or believe in
"ethnicism," "tribalism," etc., or whatever else you want to label it). It's not a question of if, but to what degree. I postulate that it is a result
of evolution. Back in the primordial days, when the daily task for different clans and tribes was to attack and raid each other, those
who knew well enough to recognize and stay away from those of a different group probably had a better chance of surviving. Thus this 
instinct got passed on, and that is why I think this impulse is innate in all humans. (For a more scientific discussion of this topic, see this
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/30/opinion/30kristof.html?ref=opinion" target="_blank">article on the NYTimes.com</a> Web site.) </p>

<p>Now moving on to the Spanish F1 fans. According to 
<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/motorsport/formulaone/lewishamilton/3287052/Spanish-racists-target-Lewis-Hamilton-in-voodoo-campaign-ahead-of-Brazilian-Grand-Prix--Formula-One.html" target="_blank">
The Daily Telegraph</a>, some of them have apparently set up a Web site attacking McLaren driver Lewis Hamilton, ahead of the ahead of 
the season-ending Brazilian Grand Prix. Hamilton needs at least a fifth-place finish on Sunday to become the F1's youngest world champion. </p>

<p>The Web site is filled with attacks and other hate speech, much of which is racist. One post reads: "Half-breed, kill yourself in your car."
Others express hopes of Hamilton having a blowout or some other type of mishap or accident. Pictures taken at a testing weekend in
February showed some fans gesturing at Hamilton and a group in blackface wearing t-shirts that said "Hamilton's Family."</p>

<p>Now those of us who read some of the sports news that come out of Spain have reasonably come to the conclusion that a lot of Spanish
soccer and racing fans are racist. Even their sports teams have displayed racist attitudes, which I wrote about on a few occasions 
(<a href="http://www.solitaryone.com/?page=articles/2008/08/blogindex_200808#art_20080815">Apparently Spaniards Love To
Chink It Up<a>; <a href="http://www.solitaryone.com/?page=articles/2008/08/blogindex_200808#art_20080813">A New Ethnic Group Discovered: 
a Slit-eyed, Spanish-speaking and Tall People</a>).</p>

<p>So I guess I shouldn't be surprised by this latest bit of news. It's just that when one thinks of racist Europeans, Spaniards would not
be the first group to come to mind. Usually it is Germans, perhaps unfairly since the association is with the Nazis and Germans of WWII;
today's Germans seem to be much more open-minded as a result of their history. But now we might have to rearrange that mental model in our
minds, and when we think of racist Europeans, maybe we have short changed Spaniards and they perhaps deserve top billing.</p>

<p>Without repeating myself, it is interesting that these Spanish fans hate Hamilton because of his racially mixed background. As I 
mentioned in the <a href="http://www.solitaryone.com/?page=articles/2008/08/blogindex_200808#art_20080815">Apparently Spaniards Love To
Chink It Up<a> post, in relation to the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pm_LbJTvTWA" target="_blank">famous dialogue 
between Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper's characters in <b><i>True Romance</i></b></a> regarding Sicilians, since Spain was ruled by Moors
for a couple of centuries, many Spaniards probably are, like Hamilton, the progeny of mixed European and North African people. </p>

<p>Nonetheless, you can't override a genetic propensity with logic. God knows emotions trump logic.</p>

<p class="dateline">Thursday, October 23, 2008</p>
      
<p class="headline">In the "Real America," You're an Elitist, and I Don't Like Labeling People</p>

<p>In Thursday's part of a multi-part McCain/Palin interview with NBC's Brian Williams, Palin, in response to a question, said she doesn't like labels.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.solitaryone.com/images/articles/2008/10/hypocrisy.jpg" width="490" height="392" alt="Hypocrisy: National Association of Telemarketers.
Absolutely no soliciting" title="Hypocrisy: National Association of Telemarketers. Absolutely no soliciting"></p>

<p>In one part of the interview, Williams asks Palin to describe what she meant by "elite," and to define who the "elitists" are. The reason Williams asked
this question is because the McCain/Palin campaign has on countless occasions attacked their opponents and their supporters with the label of "elitist." She 
said that it was anyone who thought they were better than anyone else. When pressed as to whether it wasn't a particular background, education, economic class,
she refused to concede that she had implied just those things. McCain came to her defense and said that the elitists are located in Washington and New York.</p>

<p>In answer to a question about implying in ads that Obama was an associate of terrorists, Palin gave her standard answer about Ayers and how he bombed government
buildings. When Williams asked whether that classification of "terrorist" applies to those who bomb abortion clinics and those who set fire during protests, Palin's
response ignored Williams's question and returned to Ayers. </p>

<p>OK, so far, standard stuff. Now here's the kicker.</p>

<p><blockquote>
<u>Williams</u>: Governor Palin, are you a feminist?<br>
<u>Palin</u>: I'm not going to label anyone, or any part of America. I'm not going to label myself. </blockquote></p>

<p>Wow. I'm speechless.</p>

<p>This coming from someone who puts labels on everything: which parts of America are the "real America, pro-America;" "elitists"; patriotic Americans,
"liberals;" "feminist elites;" etc. I mean, most people at least try to hide or cover up their hypocrisy but&#8212;perhaps maybe because she's too inane or daft,
or whatever may be the cause&#8212;she just lays it out there for all to see, so blatant that even a blind person couldn't miss it.</p>

<p>I really don't know how else to address this blatant hypocrisy. All politicians, nay people, are hypocrites to some extent. But someone who can, with a straight
face, say in one breath who the "elites" and "pro-America" are, and then in the next say she doesn't like labeling people...</p>

<p>Critical words fail me. </p>
