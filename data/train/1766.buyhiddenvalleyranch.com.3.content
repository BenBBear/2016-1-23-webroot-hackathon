&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to our Hidden Valley Ranch. This is a "One Of A Kind" property ready and permitted for immediate development of your dream home. Located in the beautiful Applegate Valley, just 5 miles from Grants Pass, Oregon. While no longer a "Working Ranch" this roughly 40 acres is a large portion of the original Hidden Valley Ranch in Southern Oregon.<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While looking over the level slightly rolling fields and pastures of this property, you have beautiful views of the surrounding Lower Applegate Valley and Mountains.<img src="photos/pic-109.jpg" width=400 height=300 border=0 alt="" align="right" hspace=5 vspace=5>  While most other properties in this area are designated "Rural Residential Five Acres" (RR-5), this large parcel gives you the seclusion you want for your dream home, with the knowledge you are near schools, shopping, recreation and more, and the security of nearby emergency services if the need ever arises.<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This property description as it is currently laid out is as follows:<p></font>

<font face="" color="Navy"><i><ul>
<li><b>507 Hidden Valley Road - Grants Pass, Oregon 97527</b><p>
<li>38.79 Acres Level to Slightly Rolling Land (No More Than 3* Grade)<p>
<li>Residential = 1.00 Acre   <p>
<li>Irrigation Rights = 11.3 Acres   <p>
<li>Small Tract Forest = 6.00 Acres   <p>
<li>Agriculture = 27.27 Acres   <p>
</ul> <p></i></font>

<font face="" size="+1">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The property has three (3) ground water wells, an irrigation pond, a seasonal creek, and is forested on the South and East assuring additional privacy. The original building pads for a house, barn/shop, and garage remain intact, with electric and telephone service to the same. <p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no question of ability to build on the property as we have a current Josephine County, Oregon "Transferable Development Permit" in hand allowing you, immediate construction of your dream home. The current access to the property is a well maintained driveway, and our property includes an additional 30 foot "Private Deeded Access".<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our own previous use of the property included hay production, along with horse, and cattle grazing. As there are many quality vineyards in the area, this may be an ideal property for starting your own label. With the amount of pasture, it would also make a great horse or cattle ranch. The ideas for the use of this property are only limited to your creativity &amp; imagination. <p>

<img src="photos/pic-111.jpg" width=400 height=300 border=0 alt="" align="left" hspace=10 vspace=7>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The property has been "Fallow" <i>(not farmed, fertilized, or sprayed)</i> for approximately 10 years, if you wish to organic farm. There are many existing producing fruit trees on the property including Pear, Apple, &amp; more.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public K - 12 schools include Three Rivers School District (Madrona Elementary, Lincoln Savage Middle School, &amp; Hidden Valley High School), Private K&nbsp;-&nbsp;12 include New Hope Christian School, Brighton Academy, and Woodland Charter School K - 6 is coming soon.  With Oregon's new "Open Enrolment Policy" it may also be possible for your children to attend "Grants Pass City Schools" (Allendale Elementary, South Middle School, Grants Pass High School) but of course that depends on the school districts policy at your time of application. Nearby Colleges &amp; Universities include Rogue Community College and Southern Oregon University in Ashland, Oregon.<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please visit our "<a href="aroundthearea.html">Around The Area</a>" page for additional things like the nearby golf courses, hospital, vineyards, churches, outdoor activities, national parks, beaches, rivers and the like. <p>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you're considering moving out into the country and your friends say your nuts; they say "There's Nothing To Do Out There!".   Well now, on occasion we all feel that way, but not to worry. With just an hour or few drive from your "Dream Home on the Range" we have big city nightlife. Portland, Oregon - Reno, Nevada - Boise, Idaho just to name a few. Into gambling??? Try Seven Feathers in Canyonville, Mill Casino in Coos Bay, Spirit Mountain outside Salem, Lucky 7 in Smith River, California, or Elk Valley Casino in Crescent City, California, all making a nice day or overnight trip.<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or you think you're going to miss the skiing at Manmonth Lakes??  Still a 8 hour drive, or Ski "Hood" that's where the U.S.A. Olympic Team practices year round. Right in our own backyard we have annual para-sail, hot air balloon, competitions, Boatnick jet boat races, Bike Oregon Rallies, Classic Car Gatherings and much much more.<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you're a young family just starting out, this is a great area to raise your kids. If you're thinking about retiring but don't wish to sit around all day, you won't find a much friendlier place to share activities with others in your same position. Don't believe us, come up for a visit and see for yourself.<p>
