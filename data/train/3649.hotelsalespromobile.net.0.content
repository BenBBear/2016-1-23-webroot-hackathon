LICENSE AGREEMENT

PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING CAREFULLY.  BY “CLICKING” ON THE “LOGIN” BUTTON AND ACCESSING THE WEBSITE MAINTAINED BY HOTEL SALESPRO, LLC (“HOTEL SALESPRO”) AND INSTALLING OR USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU INDICATE YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF AND AGREEMENT TO THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS.  IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, DO NOT “CLICK” ON THE “I AGREE” BUTTON BELOW, BUT “CLICK” ON THE “I DISAGREE” BUTTON.   
THIS AGREEMENT, TOGETHER WITH THE COMPLETED “NEW PROPERTY SETUP FORM” PROVIDED ON THE “GETTING STARTED” PAGE (THE “SETUP FORM”), CONSTITUTES THE COMPLETE AND EXCLUSIVE STATEMENT OF THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND HOTEL SALESPRO WITH RESPECT TO THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT, SUPERSEDES ANY PROPOSAL OR PRIOR AGREEMENT, ORAL OR WRITTEN, AND ANY OTHER COMMUNICATIONS RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, AND GOVERNS ALL PAST, CURRENT AND FUTURE USE OF THE SOFTWARE REFERRED TO IN THIS AGREEMENT.

Section 1.  License Grant and Authority.   Subject to Section 6 hereof, Hotel SalesPro, LLC ("Hotel SalesPro") grants to the operator of the hotel property described and referenced in the Setup Form completed by the system administrator for such property (such property referred to as the “Property”), regardless of brand or ownership group affiliation (such operator referred to as “You”) a personal, non-transferable and non-exclusive license to use the Hotel ServicePro™ software program linked to this Agreement, as well as any updates, revisions or modifications thereto regardless of source (“Software”) in object code format only and its associated documentation only for use by You in the operation of the Property.  The term “Software” includes associated media, printed materials, the data-field structure employed by Hotel SalesPro, and on-line or electronic documentation, as well as any and all updates and supplements provided by Hotel SalesPro.  All copies of the Software remain the property of Hotel SalesPro. You agree not to use the Software for any illegal purpose, or for any purpose which may infringe on the property rights of others.  You represent and warrant that You have the proper power and authority to enter into this Agreement and that the person preparing the Setup Form has all the proper power and authority to act on Your behalf.  You understand that the Software has been designed solely for use in the English (U.S.) language and that Hotel SalesPro makes no representations or warranties that the Software will be adapted for use in any other language or format, although Hotel SalesPro reserves the right to do so in its sole discretion.  You further understand that Hotel SalesPro may provide certain documents as part of the Software merely for Your convenience, and no representation or warranty is made with respect to the accuracy or completeness of these documents, or that they will be error free.  You agree to review all such documents before using them and to take whatever action may be necessary to ensure that the use of such documents does not conflict with applicable law or the rights of any third party.

Section 2.  Data Hosting and Ownership.  Hotel SalesPro may provide or make arrangements with a third party to provide data hosting services in connection with Your use of the Software.  No arrangements made by Hotel SalesPro with respect to such data hosting services will affect the ownership of the Property’s data, and Hotel SalesPro shall take commercially reasonable steps to ensure that neither Hotel SalesPro nor any third party host shall access, review, market, sell, or otherwise exercise any control over the Property’s data.  You represent and warrant that You are solely responsible for the testing, integrity and security of the Property’s data, and that You own or otherwise have the right to collect the Property’s data and deliver such data to Hotel SalesPro or the third party host.  You are required to test the Property’s data after the installation of any patches, fixes, updates, upgrades and/or new releases of or to the Software, and You are responsible for safeguarding all passwords used to access the Property’s data.  During the term of this Agreement, You may export copies of the Property’s data as needed for the express purpose of communicating with accounts or contacts of the Property, whether by mail or electronic mail; however, You may not export or extract any copies of the Property’s data or portions thereof for any other purpose, directly or indirectly, without written consent from Hotel SalesPro.  Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason, all data will be returned promptly to You or handled as You otherwise direct, provided that Hotel SalesPro reserves the right to charge You a fee and to provide such data in a format that differs from the proprietary structure used by Hotel SalesPro in connection with your use of the Software.  If You elect to host the Property’s data, You must agree to the terms of and execute a written agreement for that purpose in the form provided by Hotel SalesPro.

You are being granted a license only under this Agreement.  You agree to take reasonable steps to protect the confidentiality of the Software.  You shall not disclose or transfer the Software, Your passwords, Your interfaces to the Software, or any other method of accessing the Software to any third party or to any other computer.  You agree not to decompile, modify, reproduce, rent, lease, or otherwise dispose of or reverse engineer the Software, and You agree not to duplicate the Software.  You agree to use the Software only in connection with the operation of the Property, and You shall not use, permit the use of, or attempt to use the Software in connection with the operation of any other hotel property or other business enterprise.  You shall not gain access, or attempt to gain access, by any means (including, without limitation, by use of the Software), to any Hotel SalesPro computer system or database, other than systems that Hotel SalesPro may grant You access to in the future, and you shall not gain access or attempt to gain access to any Hotel SalesPro computer system of database through any means other than the Software in any event.

Hotel SalesPro will not use or make available such technical information in any form that personally identifies You.

Section 5.  Term; Termination.  This Agreement and the license hereunder shall be effective upon the date You access the Software and have an initial term of 1 year and shall thereafter renew automatically, unless otherwise terminated.  Hotel SalesPro may terminate this Agreement at any time upon notice to You if You fail to pay any and all required fees and charges, or if Hotel SalesPro implements a new license agreement that replaces this Agreement.  If Hotel SalesPro, in its sole judgment, believes that the Software is being used for a purpose not approved by Hotel SalesPro, it may immediately terminate this Agreement.  Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason, Hotel SalesPro shall be authorized to immediately prevent You from having any further access to the Software.  Sections 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 shall survive termination of this Agreement.

A single arbitrator shall be agreed upon by the parties or, if the parties cannot agree upon an arbitrator within twenty (20) days after the filing and service of the demand for arbitration, then the parties agree that a single arbitrator shall be appointed by the American Arbitration Association. The non-prevailing party shall pay all costs of arbitration and the attorneys’ fees of the prevailing party, and the parties shall request the arbitrator to include such provisions in the award.  The award of the arbitrator shall be binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
