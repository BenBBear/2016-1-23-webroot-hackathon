<p><script src="http://cdn.pis.picapp.com/IamProd/PicAppPIS/JavaScript/PisV4.js" type="text/javascript"></script>So here is a question for anyone who wants to answer it.  JaMarcus Russell has been blamed for allot of the Oakland Raiders short comings in the last three seasons and deservedly so.  When you are the first overall pick by a team, let alone #1 overall, you are expected to produce.  However, now what will happen when nothing changes in Oakland with a new quarterback.</p>
<p>Oakland will be exposed to the fact that it may not have been all Russell&#8217;s fault and that the offensive line, running backs, and wide receivers were overall not that good to begin with.  Sure having a good quarterback helps as will be evident in Washington this year with McNabb at the helm.  Washington will still not make the playoffs and may only win a few more games for many of the same reasons the Raiders have lost so many.</p>
<p>Both teams do have stellar defenses and that can hide the problems of teams as well and even win some games on their own.  Baltimore did it all the way to the Super Bowl in 2000.  Ultimately, however, you do want balance on both sides of the ball to enable you to dominate whether it is your offense or defense on the field.</p>
<p>Campbell may bring some balance in Oakland.  He has good arm strength and his accuracy is good enough to hit some receivers in stride or going deep.  His mobility can help extend a play as well.  He may win a few more games for this troubled franchise, but now players like Darren McFadden and Heyward-Bey have got to step it up. </p>
<p>It is not that the weapons and talent are not in place, but more the team can not find a way to get the most out of their players.</p>
<p>Campbell barely had time to throw the ball in Washington and lets face it laying on your back is not a great place to play your games.  Little may change in Oakland for Campbell, but sometimes a fresh start is  all it takes to get the ball rolling.</p>
<p>Then again sometimes with Al Davis all he needs is someone else to blame.</p>

<p><script src="http://cdn.pis.picapp.com/IamProd/PicAppPIS/JavaScript/PisV4.js" type="text/javascript"></script>When you look at tomohe Dallas Cowboys receivers something tends to stick out more than anything else.  The size of this amazing group is one that is hard to match-up with for any team in the NFL. </p>
<p>Last year Miles Austin exploded on to the scene with 81 receptions for 1,320 yards and 11 TD&#8217;s.  His speed was good to go along with his agility and ability to adjust to throws.  His size made it easy for him to shield defenders while he went for the catch.  Defensive backs could barely get in front of him to defend any kind of Tony Romo pass.</p>
<p>Add in Jason Witten, Roy Williams, Patrick Crayton, and Sam Hurd you have five receivers that all stand 6 feet tall and who all weigh at least 205 pounds.  Dallas&#8217; offense thrived last year and won it&#8217;s first playoff game in over 13 years.  The offense showed just how dangerous it could be for years to come.</p>
<p>So what would be the smartest thing to add to this Cowboys team in the first round of the draft.  Bingo.  Another big physical receiver.</p>
<p>Throwing the top rated receiver in the 2010 draft into the mix just scares me to death when you look at the potential for this offense.  Dez Bryant stands 6&#8242;-2&#8243; and weighs 225 pounds.  He catches almost everything that comes his way and can run routes better than even Miles Austin. </p>
<p>Bryant will not face much competition in the NFC East as far as defensive backs go.  The Eagles, Redskins, and Giants all carry fairly undersized cornerbacks that can not come close to Bryant&#8217;s leaping ability.  His speed may hurt him a bit, but I don&#8217;t believe he will be pegged as the deep threat for &#8220;America&#8217;s Team.&#8221;</p>
<p>The only thing the Cowboys need to be concerned about is protecting Romo and giving him time to find these amazing talents on the outside.  If they can do that then there is no one that will be able to beat the Cowboys in the NFC East.  Jerry Jones is doing everything he can to make sure his team has as good a chance as any to be in the Super Bowl which is being played this year in Dallas.</p>

<p><script src="http://cdn.pis.picapp.com/IamProd/PicAppPIS/JavaScript/PisV4.js" type="text/javascript"></script>The NFL has allot of people who work behind the scenes to help us enjoy what many of us already consider to be the best game on earth.  Someone who I think deserves a little more credit than usual this year is the team that makes up the schedules for all 32 teams.</p>
<p>While doing research for another article I starting looking over the schedule a little harder and realized how well done it was for the first week.  It is an important week not only because football is starting a new season, but because the NFL wants that week to reward those who have waited so patiently in the off-season for football to return.</p>
<p>Kickoff week has no shortage of great games and now great story lines to go with it.  I picked a few games to keep an eye on and then the one I thought was a can not miss for any true football fan.  Let&#8217;s see if you agree. </p>
<p><strong>Vikings @ Saints</strong></p>
<p>Obviously one of the best games of the year right here. Rematch of the NFC Championship game and two of the best quarterbacks in the league. I know, but we all know he is coming back so I can say it.</p>
<p><strong>Colts @ Texans</strong></p>
<p>This could be the Texans year to go to the playoffs and maybe do some damage while they are their.  What better way to get that goal started than by beating the best in the business right-off-the-bat.</p>
<p><strong>Lions @ Bears</strong></p>
<p>The up-and-coming Lions travel to the windy city to face what I believe are the hibernating Bears.  This is always a great game regardless, but and in the fact that newly acquired Ndamkong Suh and Julius Peppers will be on hand and you have the makings of a defensive slug-fest.</p>
<p><strong>49ers @ Seahawks</strong></p>
<p>This game pits two of the best teams in the NFC against each other and could determine who the division power could be in week one.  Oh yeah, they are division rivals as well and have conveniently added a great storyline to the mix courtesy of Taylor Mays and Pete Carroll.  Thanks guys.</p>
<p><strong>Packers @ Eagles</strong></p>
<p>Aaron Rodgers sat on the bench for three years before getting his shot.  He has thrown for more than 4,000 yds in his first two seasons as a starter.  Kevin Kolb has sat for three years on the bench and gets ready to start his first full season.  Could history repeat itself?  Everyone in Philly will be watching . . . and hoping.</p>
<p><strong>Cowboys @ Redskins</strong></p>
<p>The first Sunday Night game of the year and Dallas might have thought they were ridding themselves of Donovan McNabb when rumors circulated about him being traded from the Eagles.  Wow.  He was traded alright . . . to Dallas&#8217; arch enemies.  Suddenly with a Super Bowl coach and someone to lead the offense the Redskins look a little more dangerous and this game goes to a whole other level.</p>
<p><strong>Ravens @ Jets</strong></p>
<p>The best opening game of the season is also the first Monday Night game of the year.  The Ravens got much better on both sides of the ball.  The Jets got much better on both sides of the ball.  Rex Ryan is a maniac coach who loves to hit the hornets nest with a baseball bat.  Wonder what he will say in the first week of the season to get an improved Ravens defense ready to sting Mark Sanchez and his new toys.</p>
<p>So what do you think?  I love it.  Also, as if the NFL didn&#8217;t do a great job in the first week they made sure every game in the final week of the season would be divisional contests.  Can not wait to write about that later on.  Wonder how many of those will have playoff implications.  I wonder.</p>

<p><script src="http://cdn.pis.picapp.com/IamProd/PicAppPIS/JavaScript/PisV4.js" type="text/javascript"></script>Scary.  That is the best word to describe the defense that played in Super Bowl XXXV back in 2000. </p>
<p>I had always wondered why the Ravens never stayed with the defensive format that became the sole reason the Ravens even had a chance to play in the Super Bowl let alone win one.</p>
<p>Now don&#8217;t get me wrong when I say that.  Players get cut, traded, or retire from teams that forces coaches to adjust.  The scheme, however, can stay the same and can have players plugged into it that fit the mold. </p>
<p>Not the Ravens. </p>
<p>Marvin Lewis left and the team switched over to a 3-4 which does not play to the skills of Ray Lewis or allot of other players either. The defense still played well but was never the same dominant unit that it was and never really added alot of youth to help keep it going. </p>
<p>In all fainess though if I had a team with an offense as bad as Baltimore&#8217;s for so many years I would have to keep drafting and grabbing offensive players as well. Well all that is going to change. The Ravens may have hit the jackpot yesterday with it&#8217;s first two draft selections. </p>
<p>Trading out of the first round may have been the smartest thing for the team as it will save them money for the future and give them some incredible value to sign other players to extensions later on.</p>
<p>Linbacker Sergio Kindle and DT Terrance Cody join a defense that now begins to take shape and may look as dominant as it once was.  Think about this Ravens fans.  In the middle you would have Cody and Ngata.  Hmm.  Anyone thinking Adams and Siragusa. </p>
<p>Oh yeah, force those runners to the outside where you will have speed that even a running back can not outpace. They can line-up Suggs and Kindle at the ends and still have Lewis, Kruger, and Burgess/Barnes to play at linebacker.  WOW!  That is alot of talent and speed all over the field.  Kindle and Suggs will not be Burnett and McCrary.  They are faster and more dominant pass rushers.  It will be a fight for offensive lines to block to massive men in the middle and still stop the outside rush.</p>
<div style="float:left;margin-right:5px;"><a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/view.picapp.com/default.aspx?term=Super Bowl XXXV&amp;iid=7175132');"  href="http://view.picapp.com/default.aspx?term=Super Bowl XXXV&amp;iid=7175132" target="_blank"><img src="http://cdn.picapp.com/ftp/Images/b/e/b/0/Super_Bowl_X_bf89.jpg?adImageId=12641982&amp;imageId=7175132" border="0" alt="Super Bowl X Sharpe" width="234" height="158" /></a></div>
<p><script src="http://cdn.pis.picapp.com/IamProd/PicAppPIS/JavaScript/PisV4.js" type="text/javascript"></script>The only thinng the Ravens need to address at some point, be it draft or adding a veteran, is cornerback.  This defense is still suspect in the secondary.  You can blitz and rush the passer all day long , but 3 step drops and bad coverage could lead to big plays against the defense.  The Ravens had a chance to take Kyle Wilson in the first round and I was shocked when they did not.  It was later rumored they wanted Dez Bryant before trading out of the round.</p>
<p>The secondary must be addressed on the final day of the draft.</p>
<p>Provided Ed Reed returns for another season after an injury, that appears to be much worse than first anticipated, this could be a scary defense outmatched only by Rex Ryans in New York. </p>
<p>Ironically the Jets and Ravens open the season in New York on September 13th.  The first of two Monday night games to open the season.  I am a true football fan and to say that that game will be anything less than awesome would be ridiculous.</p>
<p>I can admit that I am not a Ravens fan, but I am looking forward to seeing what this team can do in 2010.  They have as good a chance as any to win another Super Bowl.</p>

<p><script src="http://cdn.pis.picapp.com/IamProd/PicAppPIS/JavaScript/PisV4.js" type="text/javascript"></script>Mike Holmgren and Tom Heckert have made their presence felt in Cleveland.  Acquiring the likes of Sheldon Brown from the Eagles and trading away someof their best linebackers in Wimbley and Hall the team is well on it&#8217;s way to changing things up.</p>
<p>With so many different needs for both sides of the ball the Cleveland Browns had to get this draft right in the first pivotal year for this amazing front office.  Success.</p>
<p>The secondary, which has always been a weak spot in Cleveland, continues to get help as the Brwons grab the best cover corner in the draft by taking Joe Haden and then add a safety behind that in T.J. Ward.  Both are very capable of playing at the pro level and are going to make it hard for teams to get away with throwing for allot of yards against a pass defense who was ranked last year.</p>
<p>Then the offense got some love as well.</p>
<p>With Jamal Lewis likely done and the quarterback situation basically up for grabs the team took QB Colt McCoy and the very large running back from Tennessee Montario Hardesty.  The Browns also grabbed OT Shawn Lauvao from Arizona State.</p>
<p>McCoy, in my opinion, has the most potential of any QB in the draft.  I still cannot figure on why he fell so far but I am sure their a bunch of &#8220;analysts&#8221; that can assist you with that.  The Browns have him now and that is all that matters.  He will compete for the starting job at some point and will be able to learn for the crafty veteran Jake Delhomme while he gathers as much practice as he can.</p>
<p>So far the Browns are my team in the lead through three rounds as having one of the best drafts.  They still need help at linebacker and another wide receiver, but there is still 4 rounds to go to address those needs.</p>

<p><script src="http://cdn.pis.picapp.com/IamProd/PicAppPIS/JavaScript/PisV4.js" type="text/javascript"></script>I normally do not like doing Mock Drafts.  Everyone does them and no one gets them right. You get excited and then have to wait weeks to see if you are even close to even one prediction.</p>
<p>However, it does create some intersting conversations and good comments for everyone to look at and critique.  Since my blog here encourages discussion and open conversation this seems to be the time to start hashing out a draft.  So here goes nothing.</p>
<p>With free agency, the combine (which is ridiculous), and all the Pro Days finally over we can look at a few things.  Trades are going to be executed fast the closer we get to the draft.  Teams will be setting themselves up for the player they are hoping to draft. </p>
<p>Please remember that I am making some predictions here based on a few trades that I believe are going to take place.</p>
<p>The state of Oklahoma will be proud as there could be three to four players total taken from the Universities of Oklahoma and Oklahoma State in the first five picks.  Just thought that was an interesting piece of information. </p>
<p>Sam Bradford continues to be the lead candidate for the #1 pick overall by senior analysts all over.  I have a different take on that though.  I know the potential upside is there but for the money the Rams will have to shell out I would certainly want allot of re-assurance.  I have not seen it with a few uncontested throws indoors.</p>
<p>There will probably be very few trades involving the draft picks themselves between the first sixteen spots.  If there are any trades to move into the top sixteen teams like the Eagles, Cardinals, Jets, and Chargers could be the ones that make those moves.  Look for the Cowboys and Vikings to possibly move out of the first round all together.</p>
<p>New England stands as an interesting team for me due-to-the-fact that they have 4 solid picks in the first 53 slots.  This means they have an incredible amount of leverage to move all over the place if they feel there is a player they really want.  Withthe depthof the 2010 draft this could be New England&#8217;s draft easily as far as the amount of talent they could end up with.</p>
<p>So this Mock Draft might be a little different than the ones you have probably seen so far.  Just a little different. </p>
<p><strong>1. Saint Louis Rams:  Ndamkong Suh, DT, Nebraska</strong></p>
<p>Her we go.  While many feel it is a lock for the Rams to select  Sam Bradford here I feel a little different.  Colt McCoy had a good private workout for the Rams so one would beg the question about possibly drafting the best player in the draft over a need.  Suhisthe best player and can help St. Louis on defense.  With the first pick in the second round the Rams could easily select McCoy and get two amazing talents.</p>
<p><strong>2. Detroit Lions:  Russel Okung, OT, Oklahoma State </strong></p>
<p>Detroit is gonna have their phones blowing up once St. Louis passes on Bradford.  I feel a trade here is almost imminent because of what the team will be offered to move down.  If the team stays put though I think Okungis the right pick.  He will keep Stafford off his back.  Withhis quick feet and strength he is by far the best at his position in this draft.  The Lions need the best at his position in this draft.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Tampa Bay Buccaneers:  Gerald McCoy, DT, Oklahoma  </strong></p>
<p>This pick should not change one way or the other.  McCoy has been the pick here for a while now.  The Bucs have been in need of a defensive tackle now for the last three years.  Many would say that Suh again is the pick here, but McCoy fits the Bucs scheme much better and offers the ability to play in a one or two gap system. </p>
<p><strong>4. Washington Redskins:  Sam Bradford, QB, Oklahoma</strong></p>
<p>WOW!  Will the Redskins or Eagles be kicking themselves if by some miracle Sam Bradford falls to the Redskins.  Would they take Trent Williams to protect newly acquired Donovan McNabb.   Would they take the QB of the future and not give McNabb his extension allowing Bradford to take over next year.  Oh my decisions.  Maybe the Redskins trade down and get a second or third round pick to add to their depleted pool.  No.  This pick will be Bradford if no one has traded up earlier to get him.  The Redskins will pick up a tackle like Flozelle Adams in free agency and draft for the position next year.  Welcome to Drama in D.C.</p>
<p><strong>5. Kansas City Chiefs:  Bryan Bulaga, OT, Iowa</strong></p>
<p>The Chiefs have an offense that is slowly starting to take form.  Thomas Jones at running back and Matt Schaub at quarterback are two great pieces.  Now a dominant tackle that can open up lanes and protect the QB is really what is needed to be the next piece of the puzzle.  Bulaga has the personality that the Chiefs like and has the presence as a main stay offensive tackle that will allow the offensive line to improve.</p>
<p><strong>6. Seattle Seahawks:  Trent Williams, OT, Tennessee</strong></p>
<p>With Williams falling out of the top five Seattle gets a steal here and fills a major need at the left tackle position.  Williams has become, in some camps, just as high as Okung on the draft boards.</p>
<p><strong>7. Cleveland Browns:  Eric Berry, S,  Tennessee  </strong></p>
<p>Mike Holmgren has made some interesting moves for the Cleveland Browns in his first year as GM, but the one that will be one of the best will be the drafting of S/CB Eric Berry.  Berry is a natural leader and will help to bring some stability to a very shaky secondary.  Along withEricWright and newly acquired Sheldon Brown.  Berry is capable of playing both corner and safety which may allow them to move Brown back to safety at some point.</p>
<p><strong>8. Oakland Raiders:  Bruce Campbell, OT, Maryland</strong></p>
<p>The ripple effect continues for the offensive tackles of the draft.  Campbell has always been my pick for the OT who ends up with the Raiders.  He had an amazing combine and does have tremendous upside.  Oakland is in desperate need of a Tackle to protect whoever may start for this dysfunctional franchise.  Hope Heyward-Bey gives Campbell the heads up before he gets on the plane.</p>
<p><strong>9. Buffalo Bills:  Anthony Davis, OT, Rutgers</strong></p>
<p>One of the top offensive tackles falls right into the lap of the Bills who never recovered from losing Jason Peters to the Eagles last year.  Davis has the speed ad youth, 20 years old, to be a solid tackle for many years.  Pairing him with Eric Wood helps to continue the strong rebuilding of the offensive line.</p>
<p><strong>10. Jacksonville Jaguars:  Derrick Morgan, DE, Georgia Tech</strong></p>
<p>Aaron Kampman will be happy to move back to the D-Line this year, but some insurance is needed to make sure the position is covered should Kampman not be fully recovered from an injury last year.  The best defensive player in his division, Morgan can be a great pass rusher for a struggling defense such as Jacksonville.</p>
<p><strong>11. Denver Broncos:  Sergio Kindle, OLB, Texas</strong></p>
<p>Josh McDaniels was on his way to showing everyone that the moves he made last off-season were the right ones.  Then the defense could not stop anyone after six games.  Many pieces are still in place and now all it needs is a spark to get the wheels turning again and get the team to go further than 6-0.  Kindle is the right man for the job.  He will be the compliment to Dumerviland bring some heat with what was a good defense.  Solid and durable.</p>
<p><strong>12. Miami Dolphins:  Dan Williams, DT, Tennessee</strong></p>
<p>I truly feel that a safety such as Earl Campbell could be taken here but Williams does seem like the overwhelming favorite here for a team in need of a tackle to anchor the defense.  If Kindle is still here though look for the Dolphins to pick him instead to replace the loss of Joey Porter&#8217;s sack production.</p>
<p><strong>13. San Francisco 49ers:  Joe Haden, CB, Florida</strong></p>
<p>This will be the steal of the draft.  Many have written off Haden because of a bad 40 time at the combine.  I can&#8217;t stand when teams and analysts write off players because of a bad run.  Haden is going to be one of the best and he knows it.  Haden is a player and we have all seen it before.  40 times don&#8217;t make or break a player just a teams bank.</p>
<p><strong>14. Seattle Seahawks:  C.J. Spiller, RB, Clemson</strong></p>
<p>The Seahawks have tried a number of combinations at the running back position since the loss of Shaun Alexander.  Ironically this will be the best running back the team has had since the future hall of famer.  Spiller is quick and offensively agressive when it comes to running the ball.  He is also capable as a return man and receiver out of the backfield.  Plays at a whole other level and speed.</p>
<p><strong>15. New York Giants:  Rolando McClain, ILB, Alabama</strong></p>
<p>Easy pick here.  With Antonio Pierce gone there is a gaping hole in the middle of the G-men&#8217;s defense.  McClain is the leader that can get this defense back on track from a year that was less than stellar.  McClain is a durable and instinctive leader and had more tackles for a loss than any other player in college last year.  This is practically a gift if he is still here.</p>
<p><strong>16. Tennessee Titans:  Jason Pierre-Paul, DE, South Florida</strong></p>
<p>Hard to ignore the fact that he only played in seven games.  Also hard to ignore the fact that he has the most athletic ability since Mario Williams.  He is going to have his growing pains but he could be the next &#8220;Freak&#8221; in Tennessee notching double digit sacks very, very soon.</p>
<p><strong>17. San Francisco 49ers:  Mike Iupati, OG, Idaho</strong></p>
<p>By far the most dominating guard to come out of college since Ben Grubbs.  Iupati can play along the interior of the offensive line and the 49ers are in desperate need of an upgrade.  This draft pick alone could help get Frank Gore back to his dominate rushing game.</p>
<p><strong>18. Pittsburgh Steelers:  Kyle Wilson, CB, Boise State</strong></p>
<p>The Steelers missed the playoffs last year and, no matter what anyone says, the absence of Troy Polamalu played a key role in that for the defense.  Drafting Wilson, who may be the best overall cornerback in the draft, will help make the defense better overall and will help if the defense needs to go without another key player in the secondary in the future.  </p>
<p><strong>19. Atlanta Falcons:  Brandon Graham, OLB/DE, Michigan</strong></p>
<p>A player with a high motor and a non-stop dominating presence on the field may help to push this underachieving defense over-the-top and get the Falcons deep into the playoffs.  Graham is the hybrid solution the team needs to confuse opposing offenses.</p>
<p><strong>20. Houston Texans:  Ryan Matthews, RB, Fresno State</strong></p>
<p>I know that the senior analysts will disagree with this pick because of the pressing need to replace Robinson in the secondary and the fact the Steve Slatoncould still be the guy for the running game in Houston.  Yeah.  I don&#8217;t believe that.  Matthews can help to make the offense so much better and the Texans can snag a corner in the second round with the same kind of talent they could nab at this pick.</p>
<p><strong>21. Cincinnati Bengals:  Jermaine Gresham, TE, Oklahoma</strong></p>
<p>Good blocker who also has the ability to catch anything and stretch the middle of the field.  He can line up in the slot and really give match-up problems to opposing defenses.  Palmer will be very excited to get a player on offense that can help get the ball down the field a little easier and give him a second more to make a few throws to the receivers.</p>
<p><strong>22. New England Patriots:  Sean Weatherspoon, OLB, Missouri</strong></p>
<p>Sure the Patriots could take a player like Odrick to help rebuild the defensive line but Bilichick sees an opportunity to add another dominate defensive player to the roster.  This also would allow the team not to have to bring Seau out of retirement for the 100th time.</p>
<p><strong>23. Green Bay Packers:  Devin McCourty, CB, Rutgers</strong></p>
<p>The Packers know that they have great corners in Harris and Woodson.  They also know that they are not getting an younger at the position.  McCourty brings the physical presence that the Packers love at cornerback.  He is able to cover well enough and plays bigger than his size.</p>
<p><strong>24. Philadelphia Eagles:  Earl Thomas, S/CB, Texas  </strong></p>
<p>Ideally I feel the Eagles will not sit at this position.  The chances they move up are pretty good.  If they stay put they go with the second best safety in the draft who can also play cornerback as well.  The Eagles will now have two playerswho can move all over with the addition of Thomas and Marlin Jackson.  Which one will take over for the departed Sheldon Brown remains to be seen.</p>
<p><strong>25. Baltimore Ravens:  Taylor Mays, S, USC</strong></p>
<p>Ed Reed has not decided whether or not he is going to return next season after a serious neck injury.  No matter, Mays brings the physical presence and dominating skills to make up for the loss if that is what happens.  Mays with Ray Lewis.  Ouch!  Not a defense that anyone wants to face.</p>
<p><strong>26. Arizona Cardinals:  Carlos Dunlap, DE, Florida</strong></p>
<p>The Cardinals showed in the playoffs last year against the Packers that if you can not get to the quarterback to slow down the offense you had better get ready for a shootout.  With Warner the Cardinals are OK with that.  With Leinart, no way.  The desert needs someone to help keep the pressure on.  Enter Dunlap.</p>
<p><strong>27. Dallas Cowboys:  Charles Brown, OT, USC</strong></p>
<p>With the release of Flozelle Adams it is a pretty safe bet that the Cowboys will be looking to upgrade the offensive line.  Brown is more than adequate to do just that.  He showed his enormous talents at the combine.  He can step in immediately and start.</p>
<p><strong>28. San Diego Chargers:  Terrance Cody, NT, Alabama</strong></p>
<p>Kind of a trendy pick here.  But, if you lose someone like Jamall Williams in the middle and that has been a mainstay of your defense for years than a replacement is needed in some form.  In this case it is almost the same exact form.  Just not sure about the same exact ability.</p>
<p><strong>29. New York Jets:  Dez Bryant, WR, Oklahoma State</strong></p>
<p>So here is where the top 5 talent lands.  Many think it is a risk to take this young man but let me assure you of this small fact.  If Rex Ryan takes him this far down than he will not only get a great receiver for Sanchez to have opposite of Edwards, but also get a young man with a hell of alot to prove.  Dangerous combination.</p>
<p><strong>30. Minnesota Vikings:  Patrick Robinson, CB, Florida State</strong></p>
<p>The Vikings are still my pick as the best team in the NFL . . . with Brett Favre at the helm that is.  So I could see a quarterback going here, but we all know that after Favreretiresand un-retires again all the Vikings will really need is another good secondary player to help slow down some talented receivers. </p>
<p><strong>31. Indianapolis Colts:  Maurice Pouncey, C, Florida</strong></p>
<p>The Colts really do not have alot of needs.  The team can take just about anyone and turn them into a productive player.  So this may be a good time to start looking for Jeff Saturday&#8217;s replacement.  Pouncey is an NFL ready center and amazing leader who can take control of the offensive line.  Great centers are not the easiest to find in the draft either.</p>
<p><strong>32. New Orleans Saints:  Everson Griffen, DE, USC</strong></p>
<p>Someone had Tim Tebow going here and I just found myself laughing uncontrollably.  Sean Payton has one of the best and a quarterback here.  Right.  No I think that Charles Grant&#8217;s replacement is a better choice.  Griffen has good agility but often plays a little too soft.  He only started one year at USC, but Peyton is a genius and will find a way to get the best out of this young man.</p>

<p>I mean let&#8217;s be honest, there is now no reason for the Redskins to move up and grab Bradford as their top choice.  The Redskins can sit at #4 and take Trent Williams at left tackle.  Anyone that thinks otherwise has not watched the offensive line for Washington in a while.  For McNabb&#8217;s sake and the Redskin&#8217;s investment in him they will take a OT.</p>
<p>The Lions will snag Okung at #2 but I truly feel that Ndamkong Suh should be the pick.  He has the talent and should be the one going #1 overall. </p>
<p>After Detroit the only picks that could get a little tricky will be with Seattle and San Francisco.  They each have two picks in the first round all within the top 20.  That leaves both with alot of options. </p>
<p>The 49ers will most likely take a CB such as Joe Haden and a offensive lineman such as Iupati who can play center and guard.</p>
<p>The Seahawks are a little tougher.  I see them grabbing C.J.Spiller to help their non-existent running game and one of the top DT, Gerald McCoy, who will still be miraculously still there at #6.  Many say that the Bills may grab QB Jimmy Clausen with the #6 pick, but I just can&#8217;t see them doing it.  He is a reach in any part of the first round. </p>
<p>Buffalo is deaperate enough to take him at #9 and may trade with the &#8216;Hawks to make sure they do.</p>
<p>The Giants, Broncos, Falcons, Dolphins, and Titans will all target linebackers.  Hybrids such as Brandon Graham of Michigan and Jason Pierre-Paul will all go between picks #11 and #19.  Don&#8217;t expect any trades in this area of the draft.</p>
<p>The state of Pennsylvania will want secondary players as the Eagles and Steelers will look to grab cornerbacks and safeties.</p>
<p>If there is one team that I have no idea what-so-ever about what they will draft for it is the Vikings.  They should draft a QB, but I don&#8217;t think that they will reach in the first to get one.  They could go with safety or corner as well, but again anyone at the #30 pick may be a bit of a reach.  So as it stands for me anyway I truly believe they will trade out of the first round and take all of those positions in the second round. </p>
<p>This is a deep draft class and many teams will ba able to afford to trade out of the first round or move down the line to still get a great talent.  While some names will change the positions that each team drafts for will not.</p>

<p><script src="http://cdn.pis.picapp.com/IamProd/PicAppPIS/JavaScript/PisV4.js" type="text/javascript"></script>So, the Philadelphia Eagles are finally trading Donovan McNabb.  Just like all the other years they were going to trade him and the two years McNabb was going to lose his job to Kevin Kolb or Michael Vick.  This is it.  McNabb to Oakland is just a matter of time now, right?</p>
<p>Well I don&#8217;t know about you, but I believe Donovan McNabb has got to be one of the classiest people that I have ever met through the media.  He never engages in any ridiculous rumors.  He never slights or slanders the Eagles organization in anyway, shape, or form.  Despite all the years he has been in the media for everything except the numerous accomplishments he has achieved with the only franchise he has ever played for McNabb takes it all in stride.</p>
<p>Now he is going to go to an organization that has truly been one of the worst over the last decade.  Chances are he will take that in stride too. </p>
<p>McNabb has said that he wants to remain an Eagle and retire with the team.  However, he also said that if he is to be traded he wanted two things to happen.  One, for it to be a quick decision.  Two, to play for a contender. </p>
<p>It does not appear that either is likely at the moment.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say that the Eagles do decide to trade Donovan to Oakland.  What do the Raiders really feel they can get from McNabb for one year.  I say one year due to the fact that it is all that remains on McNabb&#8217;s existing contract and he has said that he does not wish for an extension unless it is with the Eagles.</p>
<p>McNabb would obviously be an upgrade by far over any quarterback the Raiders have on their roster right now.  Opponents would now have to seriously account for the passing game in Oakland which could allow Darren McFadden and Michael Bush to grow to their potential.  Likewise for the receivers.  Heyward-Bey, Miller, and Murphy all stand to gain significant growth as receivers with McNabb at the helm.</p>
<p>The offense would do well, but the defense also stands to gain something from this trade too. Oakland&#8217;s Defensive unit was beaten down at times this year due-to-the-fact that they could never stay off the field for long and get any kind of rest.  McNabb could help to sustain drives and allow the defense to come out rested and play much better.  Really this move would be a team gain.</p>
<p>The Raiders could only screw this whole thing up if they do gain McNabb&#8217;s services and do not draft a top left tackle to protect his blind side.  McNabb, or any other quarterback for that matter can not help the Silver and Black if he is always on the ground.  It is a tough place for the quarterback to throw from.</p>
<p>If the Raiders do start to win and McNabb does see potential there for a growing team than he may indeed sign an extension, but this trade has not even happened yet.  To be honest I do not believe this trade will happen.  Would it not be funny to find out that Reid and McNabb were doing this whole thing for a laugh and at the 11th hour trade Kolb for something huge on draft day.  That would be funny indeed.</p>

<p><script src="http://cdn.pis.picapp.com/IamProd/PicAppPIS/JavaScript/PisV4.js" type="text/javascript"></script>Sam Bradford has had his Pro Day and now all 32 teams are in agreement that the former Oklahoma star quarterback is ready to be a player in the NFL.  Nothing more to worry about with the shoulder injury and as any scout could plainly see there is still good velocity and accuracy on his passes.</p>
<p>The Rams will have their quarterback of the future on April 22nd.  The franchise is saved.</p>
<p>Sorry.  I know that I am probably looking at the glass half empty here but, didn&#8217;t Bradford get injured twice on the same shoulder.  I know he had surgery this time and he is going to be even stronger than before. </p>
<p>Uh-Huh.  Stronger than before?  Makes you wonder why all football players don&#8217;t just run out and sprain or injure all their muscles and ligaments so they can be stronger than before.  Sounds like a legal steroid to me.</p>
<p>I read the articles about how well Bradford did for scouts and that he threw all 63 passes, 50 of them scripted, with like Joe Montana.  So how well did the shoulder do when he got drilled by a defender.  Oh right he didn&#8217;t get drilled by a defender.  He was standing in his fatigues throwing the ball with no pressure and no fear of hitting the ground.  Interesting.</p>
<p>Have we forgotten what happened the last time Bradford had a defender bearing down on him?</p>
<p>Bradford was playing against Texas on only four weeks of rest.  Aaron Williams blitzed from the outside and had Bradford land on his throwing shoulder that re-aggravated the sprained AC joint.  Now that was a 181lb. corner back.  The NFL will have a bit more size on defense and playing for the Rams means that there will not be as much protection that was provided to Bradford in college.</p>
<p>I am not saying that Bradford will definitely get hurt.  He could have an amazing NFL career.  I just tend to think about all the other positions the Rams need help at rather than give an injured shoulder somewhere in the range of 60 million guaranteed.  One hit could be all she wrote for the shoulder and Bradford.  Then again he could take dozens of hits and be able to keep getting up.</p>
<p>Other teams have expressed interest in Bradford and that could really benefit the Rams as well.  The Redskins, Browns, and Seahawks are all looking to upgrade at QB.  With so many other glaring needs on the team the Rams could trade their pick on draft day to anyone and get more picks, players, or a combination of both.  The team can still get an amazing talent in the draft besides Bradford and fill other holes at the same time.</p>
<p>These are things that the Rams need to think about.  They say that they are not in a rush to sign Bradford nor have they said that he will be drafted with the #1 overall pick.  The only thing that anyone know right now is that if the Rams pass on Bradford the Redskins would take him no matter what.</p>

<p><script src="http://cdn.pis.picapp.com/IamProd/PicAppPIS/JavaScript/PisV4.js" type="text/javascript"></script>So here we go again.  Donovan McNabb is the center of trade talks and this time there are even details to accompany the rumors. </p>
<p>Around noon yesterday a story was reported that the St. Louis Rams had made the Eagles an offer for McNabb with their second round pick, 33rd overall, and free safety O.J. Atogwe.</p>
<p>Later in the day the Rams GM said flat out that those rumors were &#8220;utterly ridiculous.&#8221; </p>
<p>Andy Reid did, however, do something that he very rarely does during the off-season.  He let the media in on a little secret about his current stance with the whole quarterback situation.  He stated that he was entertaining all trade offers for all three of his quarterbacks. </p>
<p>I think we all know that Kevin Kolb is most likely not going anywhere and the market for Vick is not as good as the Eagles had hoped because of his lack of playing time last year for teams to get a good look at him.  McNabb is in the final year of his contract and is certainly the most likely to be traded the question now is where?</p>
<p>If the Rams are not the destination then who could pull the trigger on a trade for McNabb&#8217;s services.</p>
<p>Most likely You will have the Raiders, Bills and Cardinals in the mix.  Oakland is shot at QB and so are the Bills.  Arizona is where McNabb lives and he would probably love to get a shot at playing with Larry Fitzgerald.  ultimately though it is the team&#8217;s decision based on the offers for McNabb.</p>
<p>Donovan may have some say though, due to the fact that he and Reid are close.  McNabb will most likely not want to play for a rebuilding franchise and will want to go to a contender toward the end of his career.</p>
<p>One more team that many have forgotten about in this trade scenario and someone to keep an eye on are the San Francisco 49ers.  Mike Singletary has no quarterback at the moment despite what anyone says and adding a weapon like McNabb could allow the thriving defense and crushing ground game to be that much better.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see just how quick anything gets done.  Like McNabb has told the Eagles &#8220;If your going to trade me, do it quickly.&#8221;</p>
