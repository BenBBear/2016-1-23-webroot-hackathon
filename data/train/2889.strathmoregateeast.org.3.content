<h2>Welcome Visitors and Association Members<span class="green"></span></h2>
<p>We are Strathmore Gate East at Lake St. George HOA, Inc. Let us introduce ourselves. Our community is located off Tampa Road, just west of Mc Mullen Booth Overpass, before Lake St. George. We have beautiful wooded and landscaped grounds. Our pool has both sunny and shady spots for lounging. <img src="images/IMG_0165.jpg" class="floatRight" alt="" width="211" height="154" />We also have a tennis court. Many of our residents are &quot;walkers&quot;. They walk all the courts, which is a two-mile circuit, for exercise. Many walkers are dog-walkers and thus our neighbors become our friends. We do not, however, plan social events for residents, at least not at the present time. Please see the column on the right entitled &quot;Our Property&quot; for a fuller description of our environment and homes. <!--<img src="images/bullet.png" alt="Read More" width="10" height="10" /> <a href="#">Read More </a>--></p>

<h2> Our  <span class="green">Property</span></h2>
<p>
"Our property is wooded with manicured lawns, the best of both worlds.  Strathmore Gate East Blvd.  is a small private road with courts off it that winds through the property and then dead-ends in a turn-around.  Our lawns have berms that add interest and richness to the landscaping.  The courts all have the names of trees.  Each court consists of one-story villas made of stucco and wood, attached on one or both ends.  The layouts are three or two bedrooms with two baths, an entryway, small , eat-in kitchen and a dining/living room.  We each have a screened porch in back of the home and a small patio which is behind a privacy fence in the front.
