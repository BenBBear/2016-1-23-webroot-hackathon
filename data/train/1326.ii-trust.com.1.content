<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Institutional Investor Trust is an SEC-registered investment company offering the <font class="samsx">Sector Allocation Model Fund</font>, symbol <font size=-1>SAMSX</font>.</p>

<h2>The Fund's Objective</h2>

<p>The objective of the <font class="samsx">Sector Allocation Model Fund</font> is to outperform the S&amp;P500 modestly as the market moves up and dramatically as it moves down. The Fund seeks to create value by avoiding extreme market losses rather than trying to capture extreme market gains.</p>

<h2>How the Fund Works</h2>

<p>The Fund employs a model that invests solely in the exchange traded funds (ETFs) that represent the nine sectors of the Standard and Poors 500 Index (S&P) and the ETF representing the one- to three-month U. S. Treasury.  The Fund evaluates the performance of the nine sectors weekly and purchases or sells any given sector or treasury holding accordingly.</p>

<p>Sectors are either in or out of the model, and all sectors in the model are equally weighted.  The maximum allocation to any one sector is 25%.  When three or fewer sectors are included 25% is invested in each sector and the remainder is invested in the Treasury ETF.  When four or more sectors are included the percentage in each is equally weighted and no investment is made in the Treasury ETF. When no sectors are included, 100% is invested in the Treasury ETF.</p>

<h2>Qualified Investors</h2>

<p>Only qualified financial institutions may purchase Fund shares; the Fund is not available for purchase by the general public. The Fund is open exclusively to institutional investors who wish to purchase Fund shares for subsequent allocation to the individual portfolios of their clients. The minimum purchase amount for an institution to open an account is $250,000.00 and there is no minimum for making subsequent investments.</p>
