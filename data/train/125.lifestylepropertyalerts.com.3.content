<p><strong>Overseas Property</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All property&nbsp;markets are different - supply and demand, laws and regulations, tax matters etc. These factors can also all change over time.&nbsp;Overseas property buying is not, in our view, for 'widows and orphans', nor is it for those who do not due their due diligence&nbsp;nor use their own independent lawyer. You should understand the risk-reward relationship and realise that with more speculative markets you could lose some or even all of your&nbsp;money.<u> If you do not know what you are doing, do not buy into&nbsp;overseas property markets.</u> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Property is an illiquid asset and prices can and do go up and down.&nbsp; Investors can and do lose money on such investments. You must do your due diligence before investing in any property opportunity. You must always take independent professional advice before investing in property. You must not rely on information given to you by developers or agents or those with vested interests.</p>
<p><em>Lifestyle&nbsp;Property Alerts</em> is funded by weekend&nbsp; 'open or delete' and other introductions. As such, these should be viewed as third party advertisements and be subject to exactly the same due diligence and independent professional advice as any other property opportunity. Introductions are not endorsements or recommendations of such opportunities.&nbsp;</p>
