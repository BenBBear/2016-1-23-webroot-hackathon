    <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi, I'm Jon Kent and I've seen what happens when a home is unoccupied and the air conditioning system fails. Or, there's a plumbing leak or a simple clog in the air conditioning condensate drain? Can you say MOLD?! Man, I've seen it happen and it's not pretty. I remember one case where all the drywall in the home became permeated with mold and had to be replaced at a cost of THOUSANDS of dollars, and insurance didn't cover the damage!. Maybe the pool's water level becomes too low and the pump runs dry. There's another big expense! These homeowners could have avoided expensive problems like these by having someone check the inside and outside around their homes often enough to make sure everything was okay. Well, that's where I come in!</td>

    <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of you long time residents may remember, back in the 90's, I provided a "home check" service to many of my seasonal  Fat Cat Carpet Cleaning customers. These folks would be away from their homes sometimes for many months. Others were Florida residents that lived in Tampa, Orlando, or Lakeland and were not in their vacation homes for weeks at a time. They often found it was very helpful having someone they could trust watch over their homes and make sure things were ok. I got away from the home check service when I sold the carpet cleaning company in 2001 and resumed my career as a real estate broker here in Manatee County. After a real estate career spanning two decades, I now want to help homeowners care for their Florida homes while they are away for the summer.</td>

    <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A couple of my favorite customers mentioned to me their need to have someone look after their homes when they were not there. They realized all sorts of problems can occur when they're out of town. These folks appreciated the fact that I would always help them anytime they called. But, sometimes they hesitated to ask for my help because I would not accept any payment. (They didn't want to abuse me!) These nice people suggested I start a company to provide this service and charge them so they wouldn't feel bad about asking for my help. <strong>How great is that?!</strong><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of a sudden I remembered my old Home Watch service I had 20 years ago! I recalled how my customers really liked my service and how helpful it was to them. <strong>BINGO! It's a no-brainer!</strong> This service is really needed nowadays and I can help my friends & clients have peace of mind while they're not here!</td>
