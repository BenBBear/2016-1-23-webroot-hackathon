  <p> Being healthy, fit and feeling great in the modern age is a skill. It is about appreciating that being healthy and being “fit” are different things. It is possible to achieve a good figure, and still feel awful and unhealthy. </p>
  <p>When it comes to fitness and health, there are many pitfalls, and a lot of bad information.</p>
  <p>The true (and only) road to health and long lasting youth is a longer one than some might have been led to believe. It is not about becoming a “gym rat” or eating nothing but “Rabbit food”. It’s not even about dropping calorie intake or even stepping on the scales every morning!</p>
  <p>TLC Health and Fitness is a caring, but very honest, and specialised Holistic approach to fitness and health. With highly personalised assessment tailored to each client it is more than possible, with light to moderate exercise, to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Greatly reduce or even alleviate Low back pain.</li>
    <li>Reduce postural Knee/Hip pain</li>
    <li>Reduce postural Neck and Shoulder pain</li>
    <li>Feel a lot healthier, taller and confident with increased energy levels </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Also, it is possible to focus on other fitness related goals such as increasing muscle tone, reducing fat or improving sports performance with a tailored Conditioning programme. Become stronger in a functional way! Reduced injuries and better performance!</p>
  <p>The ethos of TLC Health and Fitness is to provide tailored exercise as preventative or remedial Therapy not just for regular Gym users, but very much to those who do not find the Gym environment a pleasant place to exercise, or just prefer exercising in privacy (in your home), with a strong belief that each client must be educated to become his or her own motivator, and thus feel the true benefits of being fit and healthy.</p>
