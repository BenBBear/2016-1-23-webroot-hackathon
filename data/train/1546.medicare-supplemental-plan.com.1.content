<h1>Medicare Supplemental Plans</h1>
<p>Medicare Supplemental plans are plans that fill in  the &ldquo;gaps&rdquo; in original Medicare Parts A and B. These supplemental plans are  designed to work with Medicare itself. They are offered through private  insurance companies. While it can certainly be overwhelming to compare and  choose among the many  plan options, it  is to your advantage to understand Medicare Supplemental insurance so that you  make the selection that is right for you. </p><p>
Here are some important facts to know about the plans:
</p>
<h2><u>FACT #1: Medicare Supplemental insurance plans are  standardized. </u></h2><p>
First and foremost, the plans are Federally-standardized.  What this means is that it is relatively easy to compare the different plan  options. You are comparing &ldquo;apples to apples&rdquo;. The plans go by the standardized  plans chart, which can be viewed here: <a href="http://medicare-supplemental-plan.com/medigap-coverage-chart.jpg" TARGET="_blank">Medigap Coverage Chart</a>. And, each  company must go by this chart.</p><p>
What this means is that a <a href="http://medicare-supplemental-plan.com/medicare-supplemental-plan-f.php" TARGET="_blank">Medigap Plan F</a> with one company is  the exact same as a Plan F with another company. Plan F is the most  comprehensive plan, and it is also the most common. However, some of the other  plans, including Medigap Plan G and Medigap Plan N, provide comprehensive  supplemental coverage, at a lower monthly premium cost.</p><p>
To understand the differences in the plans, you can easily  review the coverage chart. NO Medicare supplemental insurance plans cover  medications, so that is not listed on the chart at all. The plans do, however,  cover things that Medicare covers. The easiest way to think of it is that, if  Medicare covers it, the supplemental plan will fill in the &ldquo;gaps&rdquo;. But if it is  something that Medicare doesn&rsquo;t cover (i.e. dental, experimental procedures,  etc.), the supplemental plan likely will not cover it either.

</p>
<h2><u>FACT #2: You CAN enroll at any time but there are  certain times that you SHOULD enroll.</u></h2><p>
There are no annual enrollment periods for Medicare  supplemental plans â€“ this is a common misconception. The Part D drug plans do  have an annual enrollment period, which has probably led to the development of  the belief that you can only change, or enroll in, a supplement plan during  this certain time of the year. You can, however, enroll in a plan at any time. </p><p>
That said, you DO have to answer medical questions (in most  cases) when you enroll in a Medicare Supplemental insurance plan UNLESS you are  in an &ldquo;open enrollment&rdquo; or &ldquo;guaranteed issue&rdquo; situation.</p><p>
Some of the most common occurrences of one of these  situations are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Turning 65 and going on Medicare</li>
  <li>Enrolling in Medicare Part B</li>
  <li>Losing employer coverage</li>
  <li>Losing Medicare Advantage coverage</li>
  <li>Moving to a new state and out of your plan&rsquo;s  service area</li>
</ul>
<p>If you fall into one of these (or several other) open  enrollment or guaranteed issue situations, you can enroll in a Medicare  Supplemental plan without having to answer any medical questions, pay a higher  rate because of pre-existing conditions, or be denied coverage based on your  health. Because of that, these are the optimum times to enroll in a plan. If  you are in one of these situations, you are well-advised to take advantage and  enroll at that time.  </p>
<h2><u>FACT #3: You can go to any doctor or hospital with  any of the Medicare Supplemental insurance plans.</u></h2><p>
  Unlike with most employer coverage plans, or Medicare  Advantage plans (the other type of Medicare insurance), you can go to any  doctor or hospital, nationwide, with a Medicare supplemental insurance plan.  There are no networks. These plans are NOT PPOs or HMOs and there are no  provider directories or referrals required. </p><p>
  As long as the provider takes Medicare itself, which is your  primary insurance, they are required to take the standardized Medicare supplement  plans.</p><p>
  This also means that, because the plans are  nationally-standardized, if you move from one state to another, you do not  necessarily have to change your insurance plan.  </p>
<h2><u>FACT #4: Medicare Advantage plans are NOT the same as  Medicare supplemental plans.</u></h2><p>
  As previously mentioned, Medicare Advantage plans are the  other type of Medicare insurance. These are commonly confused with Medicare  supplemental plans, and many people make the problematic mistake of lumping  supplemental plans and Advantage plans together. This could NOT be any further  from accurate.</p><p>
  Medicare Advantage plans actually take the place of Medicare  A &amp; B. All of your benefits are provided through the private company. They  are NOT supplements. They pay INSTEAD of Medicare. </p><p>
  Medicare Supplemental insurance, on the contrary, pays AFTER  Medicare pays. They do not replace Medicare, but rather, &ldquo;supplement&rdquo; it.</p><p>
  There are many other coverage differences, which you should  certainly explore if you are deciding between the two options. The most basic  differences, though, are the way they pay (above), doctor accessibility, and  co-pay structure.
