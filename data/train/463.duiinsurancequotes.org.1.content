 <h1>DUI Insurance Quotes</h1>
    
	<p>
	 <strong>DUI Car Insurance</strong><br />
<br />
If you are looking up DUI insurance, chances are you or someone you know has recently had a DUI.&nbsp; So along with the court fees, legal fees, fines, etc., you now have the headache of looking for car insurance that will cover a driver who has a DUI on their record. The bad news is that the current insurance company may drop you or whoever has the DUI.&nbsp; The other bad news is that many companies do not cover drivers with DUIs. The good news is that there are some insurance companies out there who will cover people with DUIs. You just have to spend some time looking and it&rsquo;s not a bad idea to talk to an agent who works with multiple companies and knows where to direct you.<br />
<br />
<strong>State Laws</strong><br />
<br />
Make sure you review your state&rsquo;s current laws and that any insurance agent you speak with is familiar with your state&rsquo;s requirements regarding DUIs. Many states will order you to file something called SR-22, but Delaware, Kentucky, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oklahoma, do not, but if you move to one of those states after being required to file in your state, you have to continue to file as your previous state ordered.<br />
<br />
<strong>SR-22 </strong><br />
<br />
An SR-22 is a document used by many states to provide the Department of Motor Vehicles with proof that a driver has the minimum liability insurance required for that state. This form may be requested by the DMV from drivers with a DUI who caused vehicle damage and/or personal injury or from drivers who were uninsured at the time of an accident.&nbsp; Not all insurance companies offer SR-22 policies and, if they do, there may be fees attached for the time and expense of filing these forms with the DMV.<br />
<br />
<strong>Rates</strong><br />
<br />
It goes without saying that after getting a DUI, you rates will increase quite a bit if you are not dropped entirely from your current insurance policy entirely. You will most likely be moved into &lsquo;high risk&rsquo; and pay a premium commensurate with that. You may find it difficult to find affordable rates or even a company that will agree to insure you, but make sure you do your research.&nbsp; If you take your time and do some thorough research, you will eventually find a policy that suits you.&nbsp; Make sure you know the laws because when it comes time for your conviction to drop off, if it does at all, you will want to ensure your policy is adjusted to reflect that.<br />
<br />
<strong>Multiple Vehicles</strong><br />
<br />
If you have multiple vehicles on your current policy, you may want to take out a separate policy with only one vehicle on it for you or the person you want to insure who has a DUI. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>In short, DUIs are expensive. </strong>There is no way around that. And your insurance following a DUI will also be expensive; it is just a matter of how expensive. So be patient and do your research, it often goes faster on the internet. Keep notes on the estimates you get and compare both the rates and the coverage.&nbsp;
