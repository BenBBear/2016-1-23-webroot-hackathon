		<p>by Frederick Hoehn, copyright 2012. </p>
<p> Win Worley was pastor of the Hegewisch Baptist Church in Highland, IN. (near Hammond, IN) But I think he was from Texas. Perhaps near Mesquite, TX. </p>
<p> He and his wife prayed and asked the Lord to just use them however He chose. The Lord led them into a deliverance ministry, that is, the casting out of demons (exorcism). </p>
<p> I&#8217;m aware there was a movie about exorcism, or perhaps several. But I deliberately stay away from commercial movies on the subject because I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;re not made with diligence regarding correct theology, but rather, screenwriters take liberties to try to present what would sell the most tickets. Why worry about accurate theology? (And the answer to that is -because God punishes liars in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone.-) (Revelation 21:8) </p>
<p> So Win Worley proceeded to cast out a lot of demons from people, and wrote books about it, and held seminars at their church there, and in one or more other cities, such as Houston, TX at that church on Satsuma St., I think it was. </p>
<p> Worley wrote books like -Battling the Hosts of Hell, Conquering the Hosts of Hell, Demolishing the Hosts of Hell, Abolishing the Hosts of Hell.- </p>
<p> I was in Houston when a lady I&#8217;d met at a prayer meeting told me about three days of meetings in Houston with Win Worley. There was a bit of a conflict with the schedule -cause I was working 2nd shift at the time. But I finally made it to the third night&#8217;s meeting. </p>
<p> Worley said, -At our church in Indiana, we cast a lot of demons out of people, and most of the people we cast demons out of are Christians.- </p>
<p> I said to myself, -What? I never heard that before.- (And I&#8217;d already been a Christian for about three and a half decades.) I had grown up in an Assembly of God church in California, sometimes also visiting a Foursquare church. I&#8217;d never heard any pastor, or evangelist, or teacher say that Christians can have demons. And that Assembly of God denomination is supposed to be full-gospel, Pentecostal, Charismatic. </p>
<p> One definition of the word charismatic is, if someone&#8217;s charismatic, he&#8217;s a good speaker, and by what he says, attractive to the audience. </p>
<p> No, I mean the other definition of charismatic, meaning tongue-talking, baptized with the Holy Ghost, speaks in unknown tongues. The unknown tongue (or, language) is unknown to the person speaking it, whether or not someone hearing might understand. </p>
<p> How can a person speak in a language he doesn&#8217;t understand? Because, after Jesus baptizes with the Holy Ghost, the Holy Ghost provides the words for that Christian to speak. Jesus won&#8217;t baptize anyone with the Holy Ghost if they&#8217;re not a Christian. </p>
<p> Well yes, the AOG did have the unknown tongues, and I got the Baptism with the Holy Ghost from the Lord when I was a teenager. But I never saw a demon cast out of anyone at an Assembly of God church. I&#8217;m sure they would say they believe in that, since it&#8217;s certainly scriptural to do so, but why then has it not been visible in AOG churches that I&#8217;ve gone to over decades of years? </p>
<p> Is it because they did really have the fire when they started a century ago, but then cooled down to lukewarm as time went by? (See Rev. 3:16) </p>
<p> I&#8217;ve been a student of Rev. Kenneth E. Hagin by hearing him teach in meetings, reading his books, listening to his tapes. He&#8217;s one of the best Bible teachers I&#8217;ve found, but I don&#8217;t remember his ever saying that Christians can have demons. </p>
<p> I didn&#8217;t necessarily buy it just because Worley had said Christians can have demons. A preacher might have some bad theology. </p>
<p> Buck and Gladys Hammond were present at those Worley meetings. They had an audio cassette tape ministry, and had recorded the teaching, and made duplicate tapes available at a very reasonable price. </p>
<p> So I bought some Worley tapes and listened. The guy was giving scripture for what he was saying. Jesus basically said, -You&#8217;re either with me or against me.- It was clear Worley was for Jesus and against the devil. </p>
<p> And he was right. A Christian can have one or more demons, and if a Christian does, he should cast out those demons, as per Luke 10:19 and Mark chapter 16. </p>
<p> Thank God for that Hammond&#8217;s tape ministry, and for Pastor Win Worley and his wife. </p>
<p> Another Christian man said that as he was listening to some Win Worley tapes, he nearly killed himself while listening. (I&#8217;m sure he meant accidentally. Perhaps he was driving at the time.) The tapes were quite absorbing. </p>
<p> I know exactly what he meant, I got a traffic citation while driving and listening to the tapes for exceeding the speed limit. It was powerful stuff. Probably better to listen to Worley recordings at home. </p>
<p> When the Worleys first started casting out demons, I understand they had not been baptized with the Holy Ghost. But they found that after they did get baptized with the Holy Ghost with the speaking in unknown tongues, they had more power in casting out demons. (See Acts 1:8) </p>
<p> They also found that there was an advantage in the ladies of the church wearing a head covering, and if nothing else, just a facial tissue on their heads, during the casting out of demons. (See 1 Cor 11:5) </p>
<p> But Jesus did say that some demons don&#8217;t go out without prayer and fasting. (Matt 17:21) </p>
<p> Lester Sumrall prayed and fasted before that famous exorcism he did in the Philippines, described in his book, -Demons, the Answer Book.- If you find that book, pay special attention to the chapter titled, -Bitten by demons.- The woman had fang marks in her arm from being bitten by a demon. Sumrall cast the demons out of her. It was a national news story at the time in the Philippines, and there was rejoicing. </p>
<p> Worley compiled a list of some 1,100 names of demons. I&#8217;m not sure that&#8217;s necessary. I believe the Holy Ghost (or, Holy Spirit) guides Christians who cast out demons. Don&#8217;t ever try to cast out demons if you&#8217;re not a Christian. You could get hurt like the seven sons of Sceva in the book of Acts. They were Jewish, but not Christians, and got beaten up by the demon-possessed man. </p>
<p> Another name for Jews who are Christians is -Messianic Jews,- or, you might say, -Fulfilled Jews.- Jews who are not Messianic Jews are still looking for the Messiah (the savior) to come, and are unaware that he has already come, and that his name is Jesus. </p>
<p> The Jews will find a counterfeit messiah in the -Antichrist,- also called -The Beast.- (See the books of Daniel and Revelation in the Bible.) </p>
<p> That was a very important lesson that I learned from Win Worley. Thank God for his ministry. </p>
<p> But Worley died unnecessarily prematurely, I believe. Perhaps he was in his fifties, or perhaps early sixties. </p>
<p> Worley decided to go on a long fast, and stopped eating. He developed medical complications and died. This matter was more difficult due to the fact that Worley was obese. </p>
<p> When Jesus cast the demons out of the Gadarene demoniac, he asked, -What is your name.- One of the demons answered, using the man&#8217;s voice, -My name is legion, for we are many.- I understand a legion could be two thousand or more. </p>
<p> When casting out demons, it is sometimes appropriate to ask, -What is your name?,- or, -How many of you are there?- </p>
<p> But I believe it&#8217;s a mistake to go further into conversation with demons, and Win Worley did get into conversation with demons, unwisely I believe. </p>
<p> There was some discussion between Worley and a demon about -Faith Preachers.- </p>
<p> I&#8217;ve heard Worley speak a bit scornfully about -Faith Preachers.- Perhaps Worley thought he was somewhat more advanced than Faith Preachers. </p>
<p> But I&#8217;ve been a student of Faith Preachers such as Kenneth E. Hagin and Norvel Hayes and Charles Capps. (www.Rhema.org, www.nhm.cc, www.CharlesCapps.com) Hayes had been a student of Lester Sumrall. Sumrall founded LESEA Broadcasting, and Lester Sumrall Evangelistic Association (LESEA). </p>
<p> In Hosea 4:6, God says, -My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.- </p>
<p> I believe if Worley had known more of what some of those faith preachers taught, that knowledge could easily have prevented his premature death. Knowledge, for example, about speaking things into existence, about binding and loosing, about ignoring the contradictory circumstances, about worshiping the Lord for healing, about claiming our needs to be met, the daily quoting out loud or reading out loud of promises to God&#8217;s people from his book, the Holy bible, and the application of Mark 11:23,24. </p>
<p> Dr. Norvel Hayes said the Lord told him, -If there&#8217;s anyone out there with anything wrong with their bodies, they&#8217;re not worshiping me enough.- Yes, I believe the Lord said that. </p>
<p> A good book about Christians speaking things into existence is, -God&#8217;s Creative Power Will Work for You,- by Charles Capps. Capps said the Lord told him, -I&#8217;ve told my people they can have what they say, but instead, they are saying what they have.- (Mark 11:23) </p>
<p> I heard a young man say, -I don&#8217;t read other books, I just get my teaching from the Bible.- But then why did God give us teachers? (Eph 4:11) </p>
<p> And there&#8217;s a scripture, -Cast out the scorner.- (Prov. 22:10) Sometimes one preacher can be scornful of another preacher. Worley may have paid a price for that mistake. </p>
<p> Another mistake he made is to teach people to return curses to the sender, but Jesus said, &#8211;bless those who curse you&#8211;. (Matt 5:44) Therefore, a better strategy would be to say out loud, -I break every curse, hex, vex, spell, love potion, etc. that&#8217;s come my way, and bless the sender, in Jesus&#8217; name.- You have the right to use Jesus&#8217; name if you&#8217;re a Christian. </p>
<p> Of course, there are some people who&#8217;ve been in the ministry and did a very poor job. I don&#8217;t say we shouldn&#8217;t be critical of rotten apples. </p>
<p> I look forward to shaking Win Worley&#8217;s hand when I get to heaven, since I am also one of those whose name is written in the -Lamb&#8217;s Book of Life.- (Rev. 13:8) Is your name in that book, my friend?</p>

		<p>The definition of finance is the provision of funds or loan supplied to an individual or company. Often this term is used for the study of economics and how money is controlled. It can be also defined as the management of funds and capital required by a business and private activities. Management of finance has also developed into a specialized branch within the financial sector and is carried out by finance managers.</p>
<p> Managing this involves dealing with the optimization and allocation of funds to various areas either by borrowing or by using those available from internal resources. The word Optimizing may sound strange but it refers to taking measures that minimize the cost of financing while simultaneously attempting to maximize the profits out of the employed finance. Bad debts are poor finance management where rules have not been followed; the result of this is depressed markets, low production and a cash crisis. It is for this very reason that finance managers are very careful with finance they agree too and where it is funded from.</p>
<p> It is not uncommon to hear finance managers referred to as bean counters as they are looking at immediate returns and initial costs against the potential at a later stage. Finance managers are the pessimists whereas sales managers are the optimists who look to the future and not to the past! Often though, problems occur with small businesses who fail to see the distinction between a business loan and a personal one. Most lenders will cancel the loan if they feel they have been deceived this way because they are unsure what the money is to be invested in.</p>
<p> Hopefully by educating the small (and large) business owners of their fiscal responsibilities they may build the basis of an improved company in the future. Small businesses can be very flexible, however, and call upon friends, other businesses, family members, even their own bank for finance.</p>
<p> Finance managers can help improve their company&#8217;s profits by using external sources which also lessens the risk on them at the same time. The famous comedian Bob Hope best summed up the subject when he once said; a bank is a place that will lend you money but only if you can prove that you don&#8217;t need it.</p>

		<p>Have you ever had a situation where you finally got that perfect job with a salary and benefits? You think that the benefits are just health insurance, but find out that there are other benefits that you have never heard of. For many it might be the option of a 401K with matching or other options from your employer. It doesn&#8217;t matter your age if you have never been given this option you might not understand all of your options and the benefits. It might be something that you feel uncomfortable asking lots of questions in a group setting. </p>
<p> Maybe your situation is that money is really tight and you are just meeting all of your obligations with each paycheck. You are looking ahead at retirement with hopes that somehow you will be able to do that one day. Looking at your daily checking or savings accounts you are figuring that you might not every be able retire. This can be a very challenging scenario and many people are facing this challenge. </p>
<p> When it comes to money it can be a very challenging situation. It can be very difficult to understand all of the different options that are available to help plan for the future. Regardless of whether you have extra money sitting in an account or not it is worth meeting with a financial advisor. In fact, most people will say that once they have met with a financial advisor in San Francisco or one in their local area they have had more hope and excitement looking to the future.<br />
 It doesn&#8217;t matter your age or status in life right now there are options that can help you plan for your future. </p>
<p> It is much easier to put away $50 a month right now than coming up with $ 3000 all at once. Plus with making wise investments it can end up being more than that. A financial advisor in San Francisco or anywhere can help you make plans for several different things that take a good chunk of money. Whether it is retirement, taxes, estate planning, college admissions and the list of things goes on. It is amazing how many of these things many people don&#8217;t realize all of the tax benefits and options of making their dollar work for them instead of against them. </p>
<p> The most important part of financial planning is getting the best planner who knows what they are doing to help you. Do your research, find someone who knows what they are doing and make them your friend and someone who is looking out for you. They can make your money work harder for you than you do working for the money.</p>

		<p>There are many reasons why people get divorced. This article explores some of the most common reasons that result in the end of a marriage. </p>
<p> ADULTERY<br />
 It will come as no surprise that adultery is an extremely common reason for divorce. However, research shows that many people are wiling to forgive someone for cheating once. If the behaviour is common though, that often spells the end of a marriage. Adultery results in a lack of trust within a relationship.</p>
<p> DESERTION<br />
 There are times when one half of a married couple will up stick and walk away, possible with the other person unaware that the marriage was on the rocks in the first place. </p>
<p> ADDICTION<br />
 If someone is addicted to alcohol or drugs then it will inevitably have a major affect on his/her marriage. Addiction takes control of someone and means they are unlikely to function normally, resulting in them being difficult to live with and a whole host of other issues. </p>
<p> ABUSE<br />
 Abusive relationships are a lot more common that most people think. Most of the time they involve a man abusing his wife, but there are also many cases where it is the other way around. Abuse isnt just physical, it can also be emotional. </p>
<p> PERSONAL DIFFERENCES<br />
 Different personalities and lifestyle ambitions is high on the list of reasons for divorce. There can be many reasons for this. Although opposites can attract, if a married couple are very different to each other, this can eventually become problematic. Different ideas of the lifestyle they want to live, and how they see marriage can be a major issue. </p>
<p> WORK<br />
 If one person is always at work and a couple never see each other, this can be a cause of friction. If one is being made to feel like they are less important than the others work they may feel unwanted. Differences in career goals can also be an area of strain. </p>
<p> FRIENDS &#038; FAMILY<br />
 Although friends and family shouldnt really have an affect on a marriage, they do have an affect on your life and this can have a direct impact on the marriage. For example, if a man is too busy spending time in the pub with his friends to spend time at home with his wife, she may become disenchanted. If someone doesnt get on with their husband or wifes family there will inevitably be problems. </p>
<p> CUTURE<br />
 If two members of a marriage are from different cultures it can be difficult to adapt. They may have to change their lifestyle to suit the other person and this can be difficult. Religion also comes into it. Someones religion can have a big impact on their life, and if a couple have different religious beliefs there can be issues around this. </p>
<p> FINANCE<br />
 Finance, and especially financial difficulties can have a massive impact on a marriage. This can particularly be the case if one feels that the other has made financial mistakes which they then have to deal with together. Guilt can also be a factor here; with one feeling guilty that they have caused these problems, and maybe not wanting to tell the other therefore making things worse when they eventually find out. </p>
<p> LACK OF COMMUNICATION<br />
 In many ways lack of communication isnt the cause of problems in the first place, but it means problems cant be resolved. If a couple dont talk about their issues they are likely to escalate. </p>
