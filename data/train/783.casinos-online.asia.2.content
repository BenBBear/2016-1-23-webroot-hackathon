<p>In December 2014, the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/leisure/11739468/Battle-over-online-gambling-tax-referred-to-Europe.html">UK introduced a new taxation system for gambling companies</a> called &#8220;Point of Consumption Tax.&#8221; It was introduced to stop gaming companies taking advantage of low or tax exempt countries to base their operations. The new taxation system works by making companies pay 15 percent on the gross profits revenue from consumers located in the United Kingdom. It is a big change from the old system where the tax was based on the company&#8217;s location and not their consumers.</p>
<p>Due to the success of the scheme, the Australian and American Governments are considering changing their gambling taxation laws to mirror the UK. At present, there is only discussion happening, but over the next year there is a strong possibility that the point of consumption tax could be heading to these two countries.</p>
<p>Many American and Australian free bets companies have argued that the point of consumption tax would mean many operators would not be able to continue trading. In the UK though it has not affected the growth of the industry.</p>
<p>All countries can regulate the gambling industry the way that is best for themselves. With the new taxation system working well in the UK, the pressure is going to increase worldwide for more countries to follow the UK lead.</p>
<p>It is a difficult time for online free bets sites. <a href="http://casinos-online.asia/archives/20">With constantly changing trends</a> regarding regulatory and taxation across all the different states and countries, it is hard for them to keep up. It has led to many suggesting the-the golden era for the gaming industry is about to come to an end. It is taking a long time but finally the regulators are catching up with the gambling companies.</p>
<p>The point of consumption tax is not without its problems, though. Unlike high street operators, it is difficult identifying where the person gambling is from. The top free bets companies are calling for one taxation system worldwide to make it easier for them to manage their online activities. With one system in place, it gives the companies a certain outcome so they can make an intelligent and informed plan on the way forward.</p>
<p>In the US, online gaming is legal in three states currently. These are; Delaware, New Jersey, and Nevada. There are a large number of states though looking into the possibilities of making gambling legal within its jurisdiction. With states desperate to generate more tax revenues, it is an attractive proposition to legalize gambling. At present, there is a large percentage of US consumer utilizing online and sports books to gamble illegally. Due to the size of the problem, the government has decided not to pursue violators due to the cost and manpower needed to carry this out.</p>
<p>Over the next year, the gambling industry is going to change dramatically. Online sites such as free bets Australia and other US operators are going to be closely monitoring the situation.</p>

        <div class="entry clearfix">
            
                        
            <p><a href="http://casinos-online.asia/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/clip_image001.jpg"><img class="  wp-image-44 aligncenter" src="http://casinos-online.asia/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/clip_image001-300x200.jpg" alt="clip_image001" width="370" height="246" /></a></p>
<p>The fantasy league sports industry has grown at a rapid pace over the last decade. It has led to more and more <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/10/does-winning-at-fantasy-sports-require-skill-or-dumb-luck/">scrutiny from lawmakers that has grown over the last year</a>. Congressmen have been taking legal action and asking for more safeguards and further regulation in the sector. Even the FBI and Justice Department have opened investigations into if the sports sites that offer this service are violating federal law.</p>
<p>One of the leading companies that provides fantasy leagues is DraftKings. There have recently been allegations that the company has been cheating their punters out of money. It is why the calls for tougher regulations have been mounting in recent months. There are calls for this industry to be classed the same as traditional betting strategy firms to protect the people playing the games.</p>
<p>Currently, the fantasy league sports industry is not classed as a betting strategies site. It is as long as have key attributes that include; skill-based contests, set prize pools, and they do not rely on single sports events outcomes. The leading sites have interpreted that this exempts them from the current gambling laws. They have <a href="http://casinos-online.asia/archives/24">designed games</a> to adhere to the definition of fantasy sports.</p>
<p>There have been calls for Congress to reexamine how the industry is regulated. Many states that have legalized gambling laws are angry that fantasy sports are exempt from the law that regulated them. With the Justice Department and FBI looking into if the fantasy sports sites are violating the current law, it is an uncertain time for this industry.</p>
<p>Even if the current federal laws or its current interpretation does not change, it is getting more complicated by the day for sports fantasy sites. One of the main issues is going to be what laws are passed by each state government. In Nevada, the capital of gambling in the USA, the best sports betting system firms are pushing for a further restriction to this industry citing unfair competition.</p>
<p>It is likely that states will go down the route of passing laws that will mean that fantasy sports operators will be taxed the same as a casino. The current taxation laws mean that companies can offset their taxes by reducing their profits through including the marketing costs. If the laws are changed to meet the current casino taxes, it will mean that they will be taken on gaming revenue and not their profits.</p>
<p>If gaming licenses are introduced into the industry, it will certainly hit the profits of all sports fantasy sites and could even close some them down. If the laws match what casinos have to follow to trade, there will be lots of additional expenses needed to be paid for. Regulatory costs can count for up to 20 percent of the total expenses. It could force all the small operators to close down, with only the larger more established players being able to cope with the changes.</p>
<p>If different laws are introduced in each state, it will mean operators will have to split up their operations. They will not be able to offer huge national prizes as they will not be able to share the entry fees and pool prizes.</p>
<p>Fantasy league sites are becoming the best sports betting system for punters. Over the next year, it is going to be a tough battle for these operators. If government regulation is introduced into the industry, many of the startup will cease to exist. The threat is real and only time will tell if this sector continues its meteoric rise in the gaming sector.</p>

            <p>Price Waterhouse Coopers (PwC), one of the giants among accountancy firms worldwide has recently published a report on âGlobal Casino and Online Gaming Market to 2014â. This lengthy but must-read report discusses the land-based and online casino industry including players, trends, and revenue growth, to name a few. We have gone one step ahead by digesting selected sections of the report and summarizing them for you. It is worthy to mention that we have chosen contents relevant to this site and have summarized these alongside some of our inputs (Readers who wish to get a glimpse of the report details may visit http://www.pwc.com/gx/en/entertainment-media/pdf/pwc-playing-to-win.pdf.</p>
<p>Casino Revenue Figures â Actual and Estimates</p>
<p>PwCâs report came out in two parts. The first part contains discussions on land-based casinos while the second touches on online casinos. While this site focuses on online casinos, a discussion on land-based casinos cannot be ignored at this point considering its huge operations and strong influence on its online counterpart. Probably for lack of reliable and credible sources, revenue figures from online gambling were excluded from the PwC report. The company however came out with revenue figures derived from regulated online gambling. PwC reports that for 2009 alone, revenue derived from gambling worldwide was a whopping US$100.5 billion. The company further estimates that this will reach US$156.8 billion or a hefty 56 percentage points increase by year-end 2014.</p>

<p>Everyone knows that Asia is being touted as the next global champion, thus it didnât come as a surprise when PwC reported that the Asia Pacific Region industry players, specifically Macau, has already surpassed Nevadaâs casino revenues in 2008. Asia Pacific countries like Australia and South Korea have become major players as they accounted for 92% of the regionâs casino revenues for 2008. Singapore is not to be left behind as it occupied the number three slot among the regions revenue contributor for the same year.</p>
<p>Recession and US Casinos</p>
<p>In the US, casino owners are experiencing a less than favorable output. The recent economic recession has had negative repercussions on casino owners in Nevada and Atlantic City. Casino owners were not spared of the crisis. As expected, revenues took a nosedive. As a precautionary measure, the New Jersey government is reportedly preparing to submit an Online Gambling Bill which would help casinos outside of Atlantic City to obtain operating licenses.</p>
<p>Shifts and Directions</p>
<p>PwC also reported major directions to be taken by online casinos within a four-year time frame. Below is a brief discussion of these directions including our views.</p>
<p>1. Cross-Border Gambling</p>
<p>The practice of keeping casino operations within territories or states are backed up by their respective governments however, this set up may not gain a strong foot hold in the coming years. Casino owners, especially those operating within smaller states or regions would find ways to broaden its customer reach. The Powerball multistate lottery in the US and selected provinces in Canada are gearing towards creating a poker network. Apparently, crossing borders would be inevitable as business owners try to provide its local customers with as many players to play against.</p>
<p>2. Government and Taxation</p>
<p>Like any other business or going concern, casinos are also taxed by the Government. Understandably, Government would want higher revenue from taxes however, it may be wise to temper its imposition of taxes (including regulations) if it wants the industry to thrive. Too much imposition of taxes and stringent regulations may kill the industry. On-line gambling in France for instance has blamed the French Government for its poor performance due to regulations and taxes. Gaming businesses in UK also experienced the same heavy imposition of taxes. For this reason, a premier gambling business in UK has decided to pull-out and relocate its head office offshore.</p>
<p>3. Societal Views and Values</p>
<p>People have different perspectives about gambling. Poker for instance is viewed as game of strategy and entails analytical skills from among its players. On the other hand, table games in casinos are often times viewed as merely a game of chance and is unlikely to gain widespread acceptance compared with poker games. In the US, horse racing has evolved into a legal activity in various states. Sports-betting has likewise become a big industry in the US.</p>
<p>A few years ago, the UIGEA Bill was passed to control illegal online gambling although there are entities pushing for its repeal. We can go on discussing a host of other forms of gambling and the publicâs different views on these. The bottom line is each form of gambling draws varied reactions from multiple sectors of society. The saying âDifferent folks, different strokesâ strongly applies.</p>
<p>4. The Social Network Bandwagon</p>
<p>Many might be wondering whether a deal could possibly be forged between the popular social network Facebook and Harrahs. Deal or no deal, social networks are bound to take on a major role in promoting online casinos. It is interesting to note that apart from Harrahs, other online casino businesses have expressed growing interest in joining the social networking bandwagon. Apparently, more and more casino business owners recognize the value of social utilities and their huge contribution to increasing customer base and revenues. One proof is the growing number of Zynga poker fans who play poker for free via Facebook.</p>
<p>Final Note</p>
<p>Overall, it seems that growth of online casinos (including land-based ones) will be greatly influenced by Governmentâs laws and regulations on casinos and strategies on achieving revenue growth in the coming years. Of course we cannot discount the role of the general public in shaping the future of casinos worldwide. Whether or not it is ready to embrace gambling as a legitimate source of entertainment for mature and responsible adults still remains to be seen. Lastly, forging ties with social networks have become a trend among casino owners as they recognize its valuable contribution to market presence and revenue growth. </p>

        <div class="entry clearfix">
            
                        
            <p>As well as being able to play 3 Card Brag against the house online, a number of live casinos have also introduced 3 Card Brag into their portfolio of table games. Whereas most online 3 Card Brag games have a standard payout structure with a house edge of just over 2%, some live casinos modify their payout structure to improve the edge in their favour.<br />
To ensure that you get the best possible return to your 3 Card Brag stakes, you should only use an online or live casino which is offering the following ante odds (or better!) â</p>
<p>Prial (or Three of a Kind) 5/1<br />
Running (Straight) Flush 4/1<br />
Run (Straight) 1/1 â or âEvensâ</p>
<p>Mathematically, these odds equate to a house edge of 2.02% based on all possible combinations of cards being dealt to the player and dealer, and the total payback the player receives (frequency of winning hands x odds of return) divided by the total number of possible hands.</p>
<p>3 Card Brag Expected Value<br />
Confused? You donât have to be. All you need to know to beat the house edge in casino 3 Card Brag is what hands offer an expected value where, on level stakes, you will be profitable overall.</p>
<p>To get to this figure, you start by working out that after your three cards have been dealt, there a are possible 18,424 hands which can be dealt to the dealer {(49*48*47)/(3*2*1)}. So, in order to be profitable, you have to determine which hands will return more than 18,424 times your basic stake if played 18,424 hands or &#8211; in other words &#8211; which have an expected value of 0.50 and above.</p>
<p>Rather than going through all 18,424 combinations, we have done the homework for you, and have found the bottom line at Q-6-4 (unsuited). The maths is as follows-</p>
<p>Queen â Six â Four are the Magic Numbers<br />
If you are playing Q-6-4, there are 305 combinations of cards that the dealer can have which will enable him to qualify and still lose to you â giving you a return of Â£1,220.00 (to a Â£1.00 unit stake).</p>
<p>There are 5747 combinations where the dealer will fail to qualify, your âplayâ stake is returned and your ante doubled â giving you a return of Â£17,241.00 â and 26 possible ways of making a tie (not 27 because of the one chance that the dealer can make a Q-6-4 flush against your rainbow Q-6-4), returning Â£78.00.</p>
<p>Add these three returns up (Â£18,539.00) and divide by the total amount you will have to pay in antes and âplayâ stakes (Â£36,848.00) over 18.424 hands and your expected value is 50.30%.</p>
<p>The same calculation made on the hand Q-6-3 {(Â£1,084.00 + Â£17,241.00 + Â£78.00)/Â£36,848.00) gives an expected value of 49.94%.</p>
<p>Muck Your Jacks to Beat the House<br />
It makes sense to fold on any hand which is Jack high or lower, because if the dealer qualifies you are going to lose and the only benefit to you is if the dealer fails to qualify (and you double your ante). The hands between Jack high and Q-6-4 represent the 2.02% edge that the house has in casino 3 Card Brag, and if you muck those also, you eliminate their percentage provided the ante bonus odds are no worse than those listed above.</p>
<p>You need to be aware that some casinos and online web sites offering 3 Card Brag games against the house will switch the ante bonuses between a prial and a running flush. This is because there is a greater chance of a prial being dealt (52/22.100) than a running flush (48/22.100) and it makes a slight difference to your expected value, but not enough to warrant changing your minimum starting hand.</p>
<p>Furthermore, some sites and casinos will also have a different hand ranking structure to standard 3 Card Brag games, and make A-A-A the best hand, rather than 3-3-3. A Q-K-A run or running flush will also dominate an A-2-3 run, and although these changes will make no difference to beating the house edge in casino 3 Card Brag, it is always in your best interests to ensure you are familiar with the rules before you sit down to play.</p>
<p>Happy Bragging! </p>

            <p>You do not have to go to Mecca in order to enjoy a Mecca casino. There are many games that you can play when you go online to a Mecca casino that will thrill you, such as bingo and slots. Many people enjoy the gambling games that are at casinos today. You can find a Meccacasino that offers you all of the games that you want to play and allows you to play them right from the security of your own home.</p>
<p>While you may enjoy going to a casino, you do have to make the trip to the casino from your home. This may not be convenient for you all of the time as you have to normally travel, sometimes a great distance, when you are going out to enjoy yourself at a casino off line. When you play at a Meccacasino, however, you can enjoy many of the same games that you would play at an off line casino. The only difference is that the Mecca casino is right in your own home, based right on your computer. You just have to log on and then get started playing all of the games that you would normally enjoy off line.</p>
<p>The games that are available at the Meccacasino vary. These range from slots to bingo. Most people like to play a bingo game because it is slow paced and someone wins each time the game is played. Slots such as the fruit machines are also available when you go to a Meccacasino and are also easy to play. There are easy games as well as those that can be more challenging and require some gambling knowledge when you go to a Mecca casino.</p>
<p>One of the best ways to have fun on your computer is to play games. These can be relaxing and when you are playing gambling games, can end up netting you some winnings. You need to check out the rules of the Mecca casino before you are playing to understand if you have to put forth money to win money. In some cases, you may be able to get some free games that you can play when you are online. These will work well to get you used to playing the games that are offered at the Meccacasino so that you may, in time, decide to wager on these games.</p>
<p>Take a look at the games that are offered at the Mecca casino so that you can see if there is anything there that interests you. If you are interested in playing any of the games, it is easy for you to start to play right on your own computer. This way, you do not have to travel or even go out of your house to enjoy the casino games that you like to play. When it comes to games like slots as well as bingo, there is no better place to play than right online in your own home at a Meccacasino where you get basically the same action you get off line only without the travel and the hassle. </p>

            <p>Many people have jobs they hate or they love their jobs but they do not get paid very much. These people are the most likely people to play the lottery.</p>
<p>Lottery players will come up with what they feel is their lucky numbers and they will play them every week in hopes of one day winning the lottery and making all their dreams come true.</p>
<p>With all the people in the world you would think there would be millions of different ways to pick your personal lucky numbers, but most people actually do the exact same things to pick their lucky numbers.</p>
<p>The most common way to pick your lucky numbers is to pick your birth date and the dates of your friends of family. For example if your birth date is 11-05-1971 you may use 11-05-19-71. Parents will usually use the dates of their children.</p>
<p>Another popular way to get your lucky numbers is to read your weekly horoscope. This can usually be found in your local newspaper, but if you do not get the paper or your paper does not offer you horoscopes or lucky numbers then you can check them online.</p>
<p>I actually meet someone who wrote numbers from 1 to 99 on little pieces of paper and picked 6 numbers from the hat. She played those numbers for years. Then one day she was in a car accident and was hospitalized and she was unable to get her lottery ticket, and 4 out of 6 of her numbers were picked. She would not have won millions but it could have been worth a few hundred had she been able to buy her lottery ticket that week.</p>
<p>Now that you have your lucky numbers here are some tips on how to improve your chances of winning.</p>
<p>Make sure to play your lucky numbers every week. The chances of you winning increase every time you play your lucky numbers because chances are you are closer to them winning then the time before.</p>
<p>Donât just play them in the state lottery. You can also play lottery type games in casinos and online casinos. its called Keno, and it is exactly like the lottery except instead of once or twice a week a new game starts every 5 minutes 24 hours a day 7 days a week. As a matter of fact the odds of winning the jackpot at keno are much higher then in the state sponsored lottery.<br />
The jackpots in keno go up depending on how much money you spend per game. There are many different games and the more they cost the less numbers you get to choose but the jackpots can be anywhere from 1 to 5 million dollars.</p>
<p>Unlike the lottery in keno you can pick your lucky numbers and pay for multiple games, instead of having to fill out a form for each game. Then you are free to go about your business in the casino maybe play some table games or the slot machines. Later you can return to the keno area and they can run your ticket thru the computer and pay you for any wins you may have had. </p>
