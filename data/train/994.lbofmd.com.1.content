		<p>Liberty Bank of Maryland roots date back to 1885. We were originally named Patterson Park Permanent Loan and Building Association of Baltimore City. 
		The Association started as a state charted thrift institution and was headquartered at 2000 E. Lombard Street. In 1937, the Association was issued a 
		Federal Savings and Loan Association charter by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. Our corporate headquarters were moved to 211 N. Liberty Street in 
		Baltimore city, and the Association was renamed Liberty Federal Savings and Loan Association. In 1956 the corporate headquarters were moved to 401 N. 
		Howard Street in Baltimore city, where it remained until February of 2012.  The corporate headquarters were then relocated to its current location of 
		5612 The Alameda in Baltimore city. In June 2012 the Association received approval from the State of Maryland, Department of Labor, Licensing and 
		Regulation- Office of the Commissioner of Financial Regulation to convert from a federally chartered mutual thrift to a state chartered mutual savings 
		bank. The charter conversion necessitated that the name be changed to Liberty Bank of Maryland.  Concurrently, the Board of Governors of the Federal 
		Reserve System approved Liberty Bank of Maryland for membership in the Federal Reserve System.<br>
		<br>
		The original name may have changed several times; however, we have remained a financially strong local mutual institution committed to servicing our 
		community and members. Our product lines and office locations have expanded to meet the evolving needs of our members.<br>
		<br>
		Please take the time to navigate our web site. It has been designed for ease of use. Click on any section of interest. The online Banking/Bill Pay 
		section includes a tutorial program. In response to our customers input, Bill Pay service is provided free of charge. We also offer surcharge-free ATM 
		access at any of the 43,000 plus Allpoint  ATM  Network locations nationwide as well as in Mexico, Australia and the United Kingdom.<br>
		<br>
		On behalf of our Board of Directors, management, and staff, I wish to extend our appreciation for your interest in Liberty Bank of Maryland.<br>
