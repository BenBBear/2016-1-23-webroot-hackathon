		<p style="text-align: justify;">Because of the demand for living in todayâs society, a lot of mothers are busy with their careers and so leaving their child in the daycare center is becoming a very practical idea. But, a lot of people say that itâs bad for the child because it mars the relationship that they have with their mother.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But, there are still lots of other reasons why attending daycare is a good thing.</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li><strong>It makes them healthier. </strong>Studies have shown that <a href="http://www.novpapyrus.com/advantages-in-daycare/">children who attend daycare</a> are healthier and have stronger immune system than children who donât. This is due to their being exposed to external factors that are likely to threaten their immune system which then makes it stronger.</li>
<li><strong>Prepares them for school.</strong> Daycare centers nowadays are more inductive for learning which then prepares your child for school.</li>
<li><strong>Makes them more socially oriented.</strong> Attending daycare will enable your child to be more socially oriented because it gives them the confidence to mingle with other people therefore reducing the possibilities of being introverted.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Find a Quality Center</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To make sure that your child will be able to get these benefits you should make sure that they attends a good daycare center where:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>The child gets the attention he needs.</li>
<li>Their needs are attended to pronto.</li>
<li>The daycare center has a state government certification.</li>
<li>You have a good gut feeling that your child will be able to enjoy being there and that they will be able to learn a lot.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Consider Your Child and Your Family</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A lot of parents are entrusting their children to a daily care mainly because they are busy with their careers and so it has been one of the social norms to be able to get a good sitter or enroll your child to a good center for you to be able to go to work.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, there are a few things that need to be considered before you do this. One is your child. Does he or she want to be in a day care center? Are they ready? Do you think it will affect your <a href="http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/3111.17" target="_blank">mother and child relationship</a>? And then you have to think about the opinions of your family members. If one member is free to take care of your child, then itâs better to leave your child with this member of the family rather than leaving them with strangers.</p>

		<p style="text-align: justify;">It is understandable in todayâs society, that working parents leave their <a href="http://www.parenting.com/blogs/show-and-tell/brian-parentingcom/child-care-more-expensive-rent">infants in daycare</a> centers for them to be able to work for their living. But, did you know that leaving infants in daycare has an array of effects to their development? Researchers have found out that there are differences in the development of infants that are left with daycare and with infants that spend their whole time with their moms. And these developments affect many areas in their personalities and even their cognition.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the things that will be greatly affected is their behavior. There have been studies that were released saying that those children who spent their infant days in the daycare center are more likely to be involved in school fights than those children who spent their time with their mom. Moreover, teachers have confirmed that these children are more argumentative. It is speculated that this is due to the childâs inability to form secure attachments that causes these kinds of issues in their behavior.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Next is their vocabulary. It is observed that children that were placed in high <a href="http://amazingattract.livejournal.com/" target="_blank">quality daycare centers</a> are more likely to have more developed vocabulary which is mainly because of their early exposure to adult conversations.</p>
<div id="attachment_81" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-81" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.novpapyrus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/kids_bully.jpg?resize=300%2C200" alt="kids in daycare school" srcset="http://i1.wp.com/www.novpapyrus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/kids_bully.jpg?resize=300%2C200 300w, http://i1.wp.com/www.novpapyrus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/kids_bully.jpg?w=599 599w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Boy being bullied in elementary school classroom</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Along with their vocabulary, children also tend to develop their social skills when they come from a high quality day care. Even at the infant stage, they will be able to observe and adapt the actions and the instructions of their teachers and this is how their social skills tend to grow from.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another part of your child that high quality child care supports is their cognitive development. This is due to the provision of intellectual stimulus by these centers at the early developmental periods.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are a lot of advantages that a child gets from being a part of these high quality day care centers so donât feel guilty when leaving them there for a while. Think of it as hitting two birds with one stone because not only are you working for his future but you are also giving him a sort of prep education at an early stage.</p>

		<p style="text-align: justify;">An art may also be done by children for fun, and at the same time, this can be a way for them to discover and learn activities that would take them to becoming creative individuals for the next generations to come.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Arts and Crafts are one of the most creative artwork in history which has been a great influence in different parts of the globe. Professional artists can make an extravagant artwork with just by using their hands; they create beauty in the world.</p>
<p>One of the easiest arts and crafts work is Modeling Clay. Kids started to love making clay. Aside from having fun, they are learning more.</p>
<h3><strong>Natural Clay</strong></h3>
<p><a href="http://www.novpapyrus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Figurines_from_Clay_Critters.jpg"><br />
</a> <a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.novpapyrus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/natural-modelling-clay_80179_3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-45" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.novpapyrus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/natural-modelling-clay_80179_3.jpg?resize=237%2C213" alt="natural-modelling-clay_80179_3" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Clay</strong> is a 100% natural material, ideal for kid-sized hands. Because of the soft texture, it is easy to work with your hands or with the use of tools from the kitchen or a play dough-style set. Your clay needs to be kept in a damp cloth whilst you&#8217;re working, and then all together keep it in a plastic bag ready for the next time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Molding clay is just like baking cupcakes. Only really necessary for clay models with very delicate parts that can crack if the clay&#8217;s not baked. Baking clay can&#8217;t be done in an oven because of the very high temperatures needed. You may seek advice from a local arts and crafts association to find out where you can bake your models.</p>
<h3><strong>Fimo Clay</strong></h3>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.novpapyrus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/fimo-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-43" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.novpapyrus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/fimo-2.jpg?resize=425%2C330" alt="fimo 2" srcset="http://i0.wp.com/www.novpapyrus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/fimo-2.jpg?resize=300%2C233 300w, http://i0.wp.com/www.novpapyrus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/fimo-2.jpg?w=543 543w" sizes="(max-width: 425px) 100vw, 425px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The pleasure of deriving from Fimo oven hardening clay and others like it, is the mixture of colors to try out: to create either a monochrome effect or a marbled effect.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the approach for a monochrome effect starting from one color that will appear again and again.</p>
<ul>
<li>Configure and flatten out two squares of the same size but different colors of Fimo clay.</li>
<li>Cut it crosswise and swap over 2 halves of different colors.</li>
<li>Cut each of these new squares lengthways four times. By pounding each strip, you have a unique color that can be freshen at will. Or else construct a marbled upshot of subtly differentiated intensity.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Marbling in Fimo clay</strong></em></p>
<p>1. To obtain a marbled effect, first knead two colors individually to soften. Obtain a 2/3 base color and 1/3 marbled color mix.</p>
<p>2. Make two long coils of the same length.</p>
<p>3. Roll the thinner coil onto the thicker one, and then form a new and well smoothed tube.</p>
<p>4. Fold this in three by folding back each of the ends.</p>
<p>5. Make a new coil by stretching while smoothing out.</p>
<p>6. Repeat the whole operation one to three times.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">7. The last time you fold the ends inwards, instead of extending the coil, shorten it, all the time smoothing it with the flat of your hand.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">8. The marbling will be perceptible, in other words, the secondary color has taken on a greater number of shades. The thick coil consists now of more than just two colors and can therefore be cut up to create beads.</p>

		<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What is Pointillism?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Considered part of the Post-impressionist</li>
<li>It was invented by painters George Seurat and Paul Signac.</li>
<li>Form of painting in which tiny dots of primary-colors are used to generate secondary colors.</li>
<li>It is an outcome of Impressionism, and is usually categorized as a form of Post-Impressionism.</li>
<li>More focused on the particular style of brushwork used to apply the paint.</li>
<li>An influence on Fauvism.</li>
<li>A style of painting in which small distinct dots of color create the impression of a wide selection of other colors and blending.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rUBL8CnY6Eo" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>When was the Pointillism movement?</strong></p>
<p>Pointillism reached its peak in the 1880s and 1890s after the Impressionist movement. Artists continued to use many concepts and ideas in the future.</p>
<p><strong>What are the characteristics of Pointillism?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In Pointillism, the painting is made up entirely of small dots of pure color.</li>
<li>While Impressionists used small dabs of paint as part of their technique, Pointillism took this to the next level using only small dots of pure color to compose an entire painting.</li>
<li>The technique relies on the perceptive ability of the eye and mind of the viewer to mix the color spots into a fuller range of tones and is related closely to Divisionism, a more specialized form of the process.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Examples of Pointillism</strong></p>

<p><strong>Â </strong>A famous painting by George Seurat. It is over 6 feet tall and 10 feet wide. The painting is done with tiny little dots of pure color. Seurat painted it for around two years. See it for yourself in the Art Institute of Chicago.</p>
<div id="attachment_30" style="width: 409px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.novpapyrus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/640px-Paul_Signac_Dimanche.jpg"><img class="wp-image-30 " src="http://i2.wp.com/www.novpapyrus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/640px-Paul_Signac_Dimanche.jpg?resize=399%2C401" alt="Sunday by Paul Signac" srcset="http://i2.wp.com/www.novpapyrus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/640px-Paul_Signac_Dimanche.jpg?resize=298%2C300 298w, http://i2.wp.com/www.novpapyrus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/640px-Paul_Signac_Dimanche.jpg?w=640 640w" sizes="(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Sunday by Paul Signac</p></div>

<div id="attachment_32" style="width: 452px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.novpapyrus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/1271px-Morning_Interior_-_Luce.jpeg"><img class="  wp-image-32" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.novpapyrus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/1271px-Morning_Interior_-_Luce.jpeg?resize=442%2C356" alt="Morning, Interior by Maximilien Luce" srcset="http://i0.wp.com/www.novpapyrus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/1271px-Morning_Interior_-_Luce.jpeg?resize=300%2C242 300w, http://i0.wp.com/www.novpapyrus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/1271px-Morning_Interior_-_Luce.jpeg?resize=1024%2C825 1024w, http://i0.wp.com/www.novpapyrus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/1271px-Morning_Interior_-_Luce.jpeg?w=1271 1271w" sizes="(max-width: 442px) 100vw, 442px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Morning, Interior by Maximilien Luce</p></div>
<p>Luce used Pointillism when painting scenes of people at work. This painting shows a man getting ready for work in the morning. The colors are vigorous and the early morning sunlight entering the room through the windows is seen clearly.</p>
<p><strong>Interesting Facts about Pointillism</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Seurat called the style of painting Divisionism when he invented it, but the name was changed over time.</li>
<li>The smaller the dots, the more explicit the painting and the sharper the lines, just like with the screen resolution on a computer monitor.</li>
<li>In many ways Pointillism was as much a science as an art.</li>
<li>Vincent Van Gogh experimented with the Pointillism technique. It is apparent in his 1887 self portrait.</li>
<li>The style often used dots of complementary colors to make their subjects more vibrant. Complementary colors are colors of the opposite tone, for example red and green or blue and orange.</li>
</ul>
<p>Great painters left us with memories we can never forget. If people still exist, there will be unending paintings and artworks that would beautify the entire world.</p>

		<p style="text-align: justify;">Music has something that medicine doesnât have. If your stomach aches, one tablet of over-the-counter drug can ease the pain. But how about homesickness? Was that cured by medicine?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Music has healing powers. There&#8217;s been a great deal of study by neuroscientists on the different ways music acts upon all aspects of the brain, affects our behavior, memory and the so on. But there is also evidence that science can attest to its curative powers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Music therapy is the skillful use of music and musical elements by an accredited music therapist that maintains, promotes, and restores mental, physical, emotional, and spiritual health. Music demonstrates creative, nonverbal, structural, and emotional qualities.

<p style="text-align: justify;">Music matters. Think about your favorite song. What memories do you associate with the lyrics and the melody of the song? Does it take you back to a happy and memorable time in your life or bring a smile to your face? For you, how does music heals?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is undeniable that music has the power to positively impact ones mood and state of mind. It relieves stress, motivates and even encourage in tough situations.</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Music allows the brain to release dopamine which is a feel good chemical essential for the healthy functioning of the central nervous system; people may acquire positivity in emotions, perception and movement.</li>
<li>Music is proven to physiologically affect heart rate, breathing and pulse rate that results to physical chills of pleasure. A study undertaken by Dr Mike Miller of Baltimore, measured the effects of music on the cardiovascular system by measuring blood vessel size before, while the song goes on and when it ends.</li>
<li>Happy lyrics help us to think positively.</li>
<li>Music lifts mood, it can reduce anxiety, motivates and helps combatÂ insomnia and depression. According to the study conducted by Stanford University, depressed patients gain self-esteem and their mood improves after music therapy.</li>
<li>Music can trigger associated memories transporting you back to special occasions.</li>
<li>Music physicallyÂ heals, a musician and acupuncturist, Fabien Maman, devised the Tama-Do Academy based on his extensive research that showed that human blood cells respond to sound frequencies by changing color and shape. The findings concluded that sick or rogue cells can be healed and harmonized with sound.</li>
<li>Music protects your ears&#8217; sound-processing abilities.</li>
<li>Music boosts heart health. Now a study has found that in fact music can strengthen the heart &#8211; and improve the recovery of patients suffering from heart disease. According to the cardiologists, the findings suggested that all people could boost the health of their hearts simply by listening to their favorite tunes.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Patients with cardiac disease were divided into three groups. Some conducted exercise classes for three weeks. Others were on the same classes, but were also instructed to listen to music of their choice at any point for 30 minutes every day. The third group listened to the music, but did not take cardiovascular exercise, which is usually prescribed to those with heart disease.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As the test ended, the patients who had listened to music as well as exercising had boosted crucial measures of heart function significantly, and improved their exercise capacity by 39 per cent.
