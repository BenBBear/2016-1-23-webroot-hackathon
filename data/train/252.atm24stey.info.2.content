					<p>As the trend for high-specification mobile phones and computers continues at a rapid pace so too does the potential for electronic media misuse and abuse. This kind of fraudulent activity is becoming more commonly seen in legal cases, particularly with employment tribunals. Legal firms are beginning to employ the services of computer forensics experts more widely in documenting electronic evidence and providing litigation support, as this can be crucial in the outcome of cases.</p>
<p> Computer forensics can be used to track and provide evidence in cases of intellectual property theft, money laundering, hacking, moonlighting and the accessing of illegal or inappropriate websites. Digital forensics can also help to secure concrete evidence of illegal activity not usually associated with electronic devices including blackmail, drug dealings and abusive behaviour. </p>
<p> Regardless of whether digital forensics is being used in a criminal case or a civil matter (even as part of an E-discovery exercise), maintaining chain of custody is vital. This is the fully documented tracking of evidence for the period of time that the forensics team has possession of an electronic device. It ensures that each member of the team can be held accountable for any action that they take with the media. </p>
<p> The purpose of this chain is to log the movements of the data, how it has been stored and subsequently analysed. It is essential that this documentation presents an accurate description of any copying, transportation and storage that has occurred, to prevent any potential legal challenge.</p>

<p> 3.Tech Support<br />
 The Internet is open every hour of every day. It doesn&#8221;t close or have business hours so your Web host tech support shouldn&#8221;t either. If you are browsing the Internet at 11:30 p.m. and realize that your site isn&#8221;t working properly, you should be able to call Tech Support and get a real person and get a solution. Otherwise, they aren&#8221;t really support.</p>

					<p>If you still rely on a dial-up service for your Internet needs, then you may be wondering what all the fuss is about when you often hear about how much better Directv Internet is over your dial-up. That can be understandable if you dont know what it is, after all its still the Internet, right? Technically, yes, you will still access the same Internet world, but with an entirely different, and extremely faster experience. With Directv, consumers make use of the same technology used for satellite TV. It is not required for you to use Directv satellite TV to access Directv Internet but if you would like to have access to both, Directv offers packaged deals.</p>
<p> What advantages are there for a person who already has dial-up to change to Directv Internet? Faster service is the biggest advantage. You will have access to web pages immediately, as soon as you click the link, no matter how many graphics are on that page. Small files will download just as quickly, which is possibly unimaginable to a person with only dial-up access. People that need to download larger files take great appreciation to only a few lost hours verses the dial-up users many lost days.</p>
<p> Individuals who use dial-up services to connect to the Internet must ensure that the computer is close to a phone jack. With Directv Internet, however, an individual can use a network card to connect to the Internet, thus making it portable. With Directv Internet the modem is</p>

					<p>Congratulations on deciding to start an online business! While the pressure is off on the need to find and purchase a physical store, starting a small business online requires more than the expertise of designing a user-friendly website where customers can browse and buy. One of the most important elements of setting up a 24-hour website is choosing the right web hosting service. With the right hosting service, you will be able to provide your customers with a reliable user experience. So how does one look for the best UK hosting service?</p>
<p> First of all, forget the whole marketing tactics on unlimited bandwidth and disk space which web hosting companies present you with. When you are just starting off, it is highly unlikely that your traffic will be very high just yet. Unless your business is already doing well, you are just paying extra for things you do not need just yet. What you should be most concerned of instead is their reliability. Reliability in this sense would be their servers uptime and speed. In fact, speed is one of the factors that determine a websites ranking on Google. A reliable web host will not constantly go on unscheduled or frequent downtime, where when it comes to businesses, can mean loss of potential customers.</p>
<p> In order to find the best UK hosting service, you will need to research on your options. One way to go about this is to look at websites that give ratings for all the web hosting</p>
