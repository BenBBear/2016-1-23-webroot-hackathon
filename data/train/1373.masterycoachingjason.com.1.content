				<h3>The Power Of Proximity</h3>
				<p>Collectively, all the Mastery coaches have completed thousands of real estate deals. No matter the type of deal or what part of the business you are working on there will always be a coach you can work with who specializes in that area.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Team Of Experts On Your Side</h3>
				<p>Having a faculty of coaches who are experts in different niches of real estate is a significant competitive advantage to growing your business. It is impossible for one person to be an expert in everything so we created what we feel is the most all-encompassing coaching staff in the entire industry.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>One-on-One Mentoring &amp; Support</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>On-Demand Coaching System</strong> - You will get coaching support anytime you need it.  Problems come up in business at any moment and they need to be addressed in real-time.</li>
					<li><strong>Email Support/One-on-One Coaching Appointments</strong> - Direct mastery support is available day or night through phone and email to address your most pressing time-sensitive questions. You will have full access to all of Mastery coaches on rotation should you need to schedule a one-on-one appointment. </li>
					<li><strong>Emergency Phone Hotline</strong> - Help?! Anytime you are in an urgent situation where you are about to make or lose money...we are here!  We have an emergency phone hotline for direct access to a coach.</li>
					<li><strong>Deal Submission Review</strong> - Submit your deal analysis to the coaches and let them review the numbers.  Doing the wrong deal, offering too much or not factoring in all the numbers could potentially cost you tens of thousands of dollars.</li>
					<li><strong>Customized Buisness Plan Creation</strong> - Review your business plans with a coach and create an individual business plan to help you create the right strategy you want to pursue and learn how to best utilize Mastery to achieve YOUR specific goals!</li>
					<li><strong>Business Review Checkpoints</strong> - Every 1 to 2 weeks, you will have a 1-on-1 call with your coach to evaluate your progress and discuss your struggles and your successes. </li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>The Mastery Community</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Student Collaboration</strong> - The Mastery community is a powerful tool that allows students to collaborate, share experiences and provide additional guidance.</li>
					<li><strong><a href="http://FortuneBuildersGives.com" target="_blank">FortuneBuilders Gives</a></strong> - Philanthropy is a core belief and FB Gives is our initiative to proactively create relationships and opportunities for FortuneBuilders team members and students to give back to their communities. </li>
