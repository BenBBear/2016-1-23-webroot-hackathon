          <p> The Central Coast Petanque club was founded by Nathan Doster.  We have
about 15 members.  Visitors and beginners are always welcome.  No boules?  We
always have spares; we will be happy to lend you some, so that you can try out
the game!

<b><i>TEAM CENTRAL COAST's DOSTER WINS IN 60+ DOUBLES!</i></b>
The team of Nathan Doster and Richard Starkey won the gold medal in the annual
FPUSA Southwest Region 60-and-over Doubles Tournament.
Richard's shooting, including two-boule hits and several carreaux, cleared out the opponents' boules,
while Nathan's pointing was relentlessly accurate throughout the tournament.
In their final game, Nathan and Richard threw a <i>perfect six-point end (below).</i>
Way to go, Coach!

The tournament was hosted by the Oakhurst Petanque Club in Oakhurst, California, on September 17th.
The Southwest Region of the U. S. Petanque Federation comprises
Southern California, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas.

<b><i>JAMASONS COMPETE AGAINST REDWOODS!</i></b>
Tom and Dorine teamed up recently to take on the Big Boys in the middle of a Sequoia forest.

Here Tom measures a close point ... notice how Tom keeps his back to the nearest Sequoia so the big old guy
can't see the tape, while Dorine helps out by blocking the Other Sequoia's view with her ... jacket.
Those Jamasons are crafty competitors!
But, sad to say, the Sequoias edged Dorine and Tom 13-11 despite the use of Tom's "Rastafarian cochonet" (left).
Tom says, "We'll be back! Heck, I didn't even know they could count."

<b><i>SUPER BOULE SUNDAY!</i> Feb. 6th</b>
Sunny and warm! Temperatures in the high 60s.
Nathan pretended to have forgotten his hat, so he could borrow one from JJ, and it worked!
Nathan's team with Barry and Catharine triumphed twice over Pat and Joan and JJ.
(But, in the second game, only by one point, coming from an 11-12 deficit to win with a two-point end.)
<br>
<br>
Some of us dressed up for the occasion wearing our petanque shirts, JJ's was
from the <i>Bocca Petanque 2000</i> club in Florida! And Pat and Nathan wore
their blinding key-lime-green Central Coast colors proudly for the first time
in a while! Always guaranteed to brighten the petanque terrain! The petanque
banners were up, and the play was extremely competitive! And an absolute
ton-o-fun!
</p>
<p>
We played until after 5:00! Over 3 hours of petanque! (We squat pointers feel
those hours of play in the legs the next day believe me! But what good that
must be doing to keep us fit!)

<b>Sunday Jan. 23rd </b>
Another perfect petanque day on
the Central Coast, and this time we had company! Linda and Carl from
the Fresno Petanque Club joined us for a couple of games. They really
enjoyed the challenges of our terrain, and we really enjoyed the
opportunity to get to know them, and to play with a couple of
experienced players!
Fresno has 150 members and is the biggest club in the US!
Linda and Carl will talk to their club about coming over en-mass to play with us sometime.
Something to look forward to!
</p>
<p>
Pictures were taken!
Take a <a href="/gallery.html">look</a> at what you missed if you weren't there!
The surface of the terrain has dried out: it is now hard and fast.
High lobs were less effective than when the ground was softer;
and the best throws were delivered lower and tended to spend more time on the ground.
Play was very good, with everyone making their share of excellent throws.
  &mdash; <i>Nathan</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>Sunday Jan. 16th </b>We had a good turnout, and the warm sunshine made for
very pleasant play. Tom's grooming of the surface prior to scheduled
play made throwing a delight. Thanks Tom! Cory's shooting was a
decisive factor for his team, and Tom's ability to move the cochonnet
set his team up for multiple-point ends. The first game of the day
started with a 4-point end. The opposing team answered that by moving
the cochonnet for a 6-point end! That was followed by a 4-point end
for the other team, and a score of 8-6 after just 3 ends. This led to
a rule modification suggestion that only ends of 4 points or more
count. But the craziness was over as the two teams settled down to
trading one- and two-point ends until the score was 12-12. The team of
Tom, Cory, and Joan took the final end and the game.
</p>
<p>
The second game was won by the team of John, Pat and Nathan. So
everyone went home winners. They were very close games with lots of
excellent throws. An absolutely perfect petanque day!
  &mdash; <i>Nathan</i>

<h2>
  <i>Masters of Petanque</i> DVDs
</h2>
<p>
If Tom starts making even more amazing throws it will be because he
has been watching the Masters of Petanque DVD! Certainly he will
internalize their incredible skills (as I have) and we will all have
to learn to deal with it. You, too, can internalize incredible skills
by watching the Masters DVDs! Just ask Nathan at the Sunday play
session to borrow one. We have the 2009 and 2010 DVDs.  &mdash; <i>Nathan</i>
