    Shuban Investments’ research services include stock initiation reports, financial performance projections, industry, market and thematic research reports, quarterly earnings updates for stocks, content review and supervisory services.<br /><br />
Investing and gaining from Equities needs you to devote countless hours of research towards the same. Financial institutions thus strive to produce high quality research and bringing it to the market and their clients before their competitors. However, producing high quality research has various costs attached to it such as hiring equity analysts with specialisation in different sectors, regulatory costs of separating the research and investment banking divisions etc. These factors have led to an increase in demand for independent research i.e outsourcing research services to independent research providers specialising in the same. Opting for independent research providers lends a competitive advantage to financial institutions by enabling them to tap into a wider knowledge base at a reasonablecost whilst also meeting regulatory requirements and client requirements.<br /><br />
