There are several different kinds of mortgage on offer. Fixed rate mortgages as their name suggests charge a fixed rate of interest for a set period of time giving peace of mind that if interest rates increase your mortgage payments won't change. You will usually be charged a penalty known as an early repayment charge ERC if you want to get out of the mortgage during the fixed term. With variable rate mortgages however the rate can go up or down so your monthly payments could change over time. There are two types of variable mortgages trackers and discounts. Trackers are directly linked to the Bank of England base rate and the rate you are charged will mirror any changes in that.
