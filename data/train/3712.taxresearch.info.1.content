With the rising cost of living and the growing insecurity about the availability of many retirement funds, many individuals are looking to investment plans to begin a nest egg or to make some additional money via investment without having to spend a lot of time purchasing stocks and bonds. <br><br>Investment plans allow individuals to simply purchase a specific amount of stocks, bonds, or indices on a regular repeating basis, cutting out a large part of the hassle while allowing for some of the main advantages of investment. <br><br>If you've been considering an investment plan but aren't completely sure what they might entail, the following information might help you to decide whether or not an investment plan is the right investment option for you. <br><br>The Mechanics of an Investment Plan <br><br>Basically, an investment plan is a method of making multiple investments over time at regular set intervals. The funds for the investment are taken from a cheque, savings, or money market account automatically, and are used to purchase stocks or bonds that you have decided upon beforehand. In most cases you can change the amount, frequency, or purchased stocks or bonds of the automatic investments at any time, though depending upon the broker through whom you're doing the investments you may be subject to fees or penalties especially if changing details relatively close to the next investment date. Most online investment firms offer investment plans that you can change at any time free of charge. <br><br>Deciding How Much to Invest <br><br>When deciding how much to invest each cycle with an investment plan, you should take care not to overextend your funds and bring yourself up short. Make sure that the amount that you choose is available and that you'll have it to spare each time your investment comes up? it can be difficult to plan for events in the future, and just because you have a surplus now doesn't mean that you won't find money running tight a few investment cycles from now. <br><br>If you feel that you're reaching a point where you won't be able to afford your regular investment, go ahead and reduce the investment amount or put a hold on the next scheduled investment? better to put less in than short yourself afterwards. <br><br>Choosing What to Invest In <br><br>Making the decision of which stocks and bonds to invest in can take some time, but it's worth it? this is your money that you're dealing with, and you shouldn't invest it without putting some thought and research into your decisions. Find stocks or bonds that have performed well over time, and that are likely to continue doing so? they may be expensive at times, but you aren't making your total investment all at once so it doesn't matter as much. <br><br>Don't be afraid to add new stocks or bonds to your plan later, either? this can help to diversify your portfolio. <br><br>Deciding On an Investment Interval <br><br>You also need to decide how often you wish to make your investments? this will largely depend upon the cycle of your paycheques and your monthly bills and expenses. You may decide to invest once per month, after everything has been paid, or you might want to invest a little from every paycheque. <br><br>The more often you invest, the lower the amount of each investment can be? after all, two or four small investments per month might end up purchasing more than one larger one. <br><br>Decide on what works best for your lifestyle, and modify it as needed later if it doesn't seem to work out for you. <br><br> <br><br>You may freely reprint this article provided the following author's biography (including the live URL link) remains intact: <br> <br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Return Home to TopWiki.info<br>?2007 - All Rights Reserved <br>. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . <br></p>

日銀は１９日の金融政策決定会合で、景気認識については７月の「さらに減速」から「停滞している」と下方修正した。これに関連して白川総裁は「日本経済が深い調整局面に陥る可能性は小さい」との認識を改めて示した。理由として、サブプライムローン問題で日本の金融機関の損失が限定的で金融市場が安定していることなどを挙げた。 
保険業法で事実上禁じられている保険事業の分割譲渡について、金融庁は今秋、金融審議会（首相の諮問機関）で規制緩和の検討を始めることが２５日分かった。保険会社の経営の柔軟性を高める狙いだが、業界再編の引き金になる可能性も高い。 
針葉樹のアカエゾマツの苗木を同行が購入し、環境保全団体を通じて２０１０年秋に植栽。樹木は北海道大学に帰属する。国債を１００万円以上購入した顧客には、植林番号が記載された証明書が発行され、現地で“自分の木”を確認することも可能だ。 
日本銀行の白川方明総裁は２５日、大阪市内のホテルで開かれた地元経済４団体との懇談会で、金融機関の中小企業への融資について、「金融を巡る状況が変化しており、中小企業への貸し出しは減少している」との認識を示した。
