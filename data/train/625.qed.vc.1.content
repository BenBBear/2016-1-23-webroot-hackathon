										</ul>
										<p>I have a deep belief in and respect for Russian technical teams, which have historically created some of the most significant technological advances, domestically and/or abroad. I started QED Capital to give these technical teams access to the same resources that allow their counterparts in the US and Europe to successfully go from prototype/project to fast growing technology company.</p>

										<p>When I arrived in Russia in 2011 to recruit technical talent for my consumer internet company ExistLocal; I gradually began to realize that Russia’s need for ethically minded, value added and genuinely founder friendly venture capital was a far larger opportunity to create value.</p>

										<p>Previously, I actively created exactly this type of value in New York City; as a part of the investment team at FirstMark Capital, a top-tier venture capital firm with over $2Bn under management, which makes Seed to Series C investments in fast growing technology companies such as Pinterest, Riot Games ($400MM Acq by Tencent), Knewton, Ahalife, AppFirst, Conductor, MyCityWay, Playnomics, Lot18 and many great others. During my tenure, the investment team at FirstMark successfully invested over $90MM in Seed, Series A, Series B and Series C venture capital financings.</p>

										<p>While running ExistLocal in New York and participating in board meetings at companies like Second Market through FirstMark Capital, I came to learn what it takes to turn Pinterest from an idea into a company with a $2.5Bn Valuation and Riot Games from a few young guys who like DOTA into a $400MM acquisition. That is what I am offering great technical teams in Russia through QED Capital; the opportunity to build their technology company the right way.

										<h2>What we look for</h2>
										<ul>
											<li>
												<img src="img/technical_founders.svg" alt="">
												<h3>Technical founders</h3>
												<p>Great technology is built by founders that can personally launch and continuously improve upon the technology needed to solve their customer’s constantly evolving pain points.</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<img src="img/clear_customer.svg" alt="">
												<h3>A Clear Customer Acquisition Plan</h3>
												<p>Great technology companies are sustained by their ability to generate a profit for their offering. Knowing each customer's monetary value and the cost of acquiring them is crucial to this process.
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<img src="img/large_market.svg" alt="">
												<h3>Large market</h3>
												<p>Without a large market, existing or newly formed, there is no large company to be built. The large risks of a startup are balanced out by the immense successes they can become through serving a large market. 
												</p>
											</li>
										</ul>
										<ul>
											<li>
												<img src="img/enterprise.svg" alt="">
												<h3>Enterprise Software</h3>
												<p>Solving a valuable problem for a customer who has a large budget to pay for your solution is a good plan. Solving it using technology that your competitors can't replicate, or at the very least can't replicate quickly enough is a great plan.</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<img src="img/russia.svg" alt="">
												<h3> Russian Consumer Internet</h3>
												<p>We are excited about helping you offer Russian consumers access to valuable goods and services via both web and mobile. A clearly defined customer acquisition plan and a team that can clearly execute on that plan are a must.
												</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<img src="img/consumer_hardware.svg" alt="">
												<h3>Consumer Hardware</h3>
												<p>As new consumer behaviors take hold and the price of hardware continues to decline there is an unprecedented opportunity to provide tangible value. We are excited about working with teams that understand and capitalize on both of these dynamics.

										<h2>What you can expect from us</h2>
										<ul>
											<li>
												<img src="img/dunno_icon1.svg" alt="">
												<h3>We decide fast</h3>
												<p>Raising Venture Capital is usually a time consuming and emotionally draining process. We respect the time and effort you take to educate us about your company and we try our best to decide on our involvement within one to two weeks of a full presentation</p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<img src="img/dunno_icon2.svg" alt="">
												<h3>Your First Investors</h3>
												<p>We will invest $50K - $200K in a company’s seed round and up to $500K in a Series A. We prefer priced equity rounds where the founders retain enough equity to keep them motivated through their series A, B and C rounds. We can do your entire seed round or co-invest with like-minded investors. </p>
											</li>
											<li>
												<img src="img/founders_friendly.svg" alt="">
												<h3>We Exist to Enable Our Founders</h3>
												<p>We don’t believe in controlling founders, we do believe in in initially choosing “the right people” and enabling them to create a company we are all excited about. Our aim is to give you the advice and resources you need with the minimum amount of friction possible, you have enough to focus on.
												</li>
											</ul>
											<ul>
												<li>
													<img src="img/pattern.svg" alt="">
													<h3>Pattern recognition</h3>
													<p>We help you avoid survivorship bias; we have seen the well known wins, as well as the not so well known failures in your industry. You save time and possibly your company by knowing what caused one company to succeed while others failed. </p>
												</li>
												<li>
													<img src="img/we_help.svg" alt="">
													<h3>We help you sell</h3>
													<p>Enterprise sales depends on the right relationships to fast track you in the sales process. Understanding online consumer behavior is what decides if an application succeeds. After working with the best enterprise and consumer internet companies in the US, we know what works and what doesn’t.  </p>
