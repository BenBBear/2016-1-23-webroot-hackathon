		<p>DSK Hyosung launched the Aquila GV250 cruiser at the 2014 Delhi Auto Expo. Prior to that the company had already launched a 650cc version of the bike but the 250cc one was aimed at the younger generation. However, the bike didn&#8217;t manage to garner much sales since a lot of bikes are available in the Rs. 2 lakh bracket.</p>
<p>However, it looks like the company is revamping the Aquila GV250 cruiser. Leaked patent images of the bike show the Aquila 250 uses a regular cradle type frame suspended on telescopic forks upfront and regular coil dampers at the rear. The new cruiser sports quite a few changes.</p>
<p>Looking at the patent images it seems the bike gets a new, and sleeker, front fender, larger front wheel, new alloy wheels, new petrol tank, redesigned seats, smaller tail-lamp than before, and a new instrument cluster. It&#8217;s very likely that this one will also come with ABS.</p>
<p>DSK Hyosung had said that they would bring in a new cruiser this year and we wonder if this is it. The V-Twin layout continues and though we thought it will come with more muscle (like a 300cc engine), the images say that it&#8217;s still the 250cc version. Well, we will wait for Hyosung to tell us more.</p>

		<p>Modern day cars are mostly all-rounders and tend to be good at everything to one degree or another. There are many varieties of such good hatchbacks in the entry level family cars segment in the Indian car market. One such recent car is the Celerio from the house of Maruti Suzuki. It offers plenty of space for passengers, good refinement from the motor, strong economy figures and is a fun to drive car as well.</p>
<p>Launched just early last year, the domestic sales of the Maruti Celerio have now crossed the one lakh units mark. It has even increased the company’s market share in the segment by almost 10 per cent. Maruti Celerio has a significant appeal here as it is the first car in the country with an automated gear shift in the budget cars segment. <a href="http://autoportal.com/newcars/marutisuzuki/celerio/">Maruti Suzuki Celerio</a> is currently offered in 7 petrol variants, 4 diesel variants and 1 CNG variant with prices ranging from Rs 3.9 lakhs to Rs 5.71 lakhs. Blazing Red, Sunshine Ray, Cerulean Blue, Silky Silver, Glistening Grey, Cave Black and Pearl Artic White are the available colour options.</p>
<p><a href="http://autoportal.com/newcars/marutisuzuki/celerio/"><img src="http://kyujinjob-shigoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/autoportal.jpg" alt="autoportal" width="952" height="635" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-103" /></a></p>
<p>Maruti Celerio carries a clean and safe design and does not have any unwanted style knick-knacks. Maruti Suzuki Celerio is 3.6 metres long, 1.6 metres wide and 1.5 metres tall with a wheelbase of 2.4 metres. The tall boy design helps in easy ingress and egress and the long wheelbase ensures ample space inside the cabin. The front façade has a smiley-shaped grille which is highlighted by large air dams and flanked by flowing back angular headlights.</p>
<p>Celerio gets beige interiors which are contrasted well with the black plastics used on the dashboard which has a modern instrument cluster. The seats are well cushioned and offer good support at right places. There are cleverly planned storage spaces inside the cabin to put away small things like magazines, bottles etc. in addition to a large boot space of 235 litres. The luggage space can be even more expanded by folding away the rear seats. </p>
<p>Celerio is a 998cc K Next 1.0litre engine that produces 67 BHP and 90 NM of torque. The new Celerio Diesel is an 800cc turbocharged diesel engine producing about 50PS of peak power. Both engines offer a peppy drive and the EZ auto gearshift technology just makes it even more exciting. The Auto Gear Shift system ensures that the gear and clutch operations happen at optimal timings thereby providing a better fuel efficiency. Celerio currently has a class leading fuel economy of 23.1 kmpl. </p>
<p>Safety and handy features on the higher trims include side impact beams, dual airbags, ABS, central locking, integrated CD/MP3/FM player with Bluetooth/USB/AUX-in, steering integrated controlsand alloy wheels.</p>

<p>Transmissions and engines have become a lot more energy efficient since 1984. But, over time, most cars have gotten bigger and heavier as safety and comfort have become more important to buyers. This is why the following list contains a mixture of old cars with tiny engines, newer hybrids and plug-in hybrids.</p>
<h2>Chevrolet Volt</h2>
<p>Engine: 4 cylinder; 1.4 liter</p>
<p>General Motors&#8217; plug-in Volt has a gasoline engine, comes out as the top one based on it’s EPA-estimated as 60 miles per gallon <a href="http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/2011-chevrolet-volt-test-review">combined electric and gas driving</a>. In reality, the figure depends largely on how often the battery is charged and how far the car goes between charges.</p>
<h2>Toyota Prius</h2>
<p>Engine: 4 cylinder; 1.8 liter</p>
<p>The Prius was once a niche product for &#8220;green&#8221; geeks to but now it’s <a href="http://www.automobilemag.com/toyota/prius/2012/#reviews">one of Toyota&#8217;s most popular models</a>, and it accounts for half of all hybrid car sales in America.</p>
<h2>Chevrolet Sprint ER</h2>
<p>Engine: 3 cylinder; 1.0 liter</p>
<p>This is essentially a rebranded Suzuki, and they relied on a tiny engine to have a maximum efficient vehicle. As most cars have grown and more safety features have been added, it would be quite hard to match this kind of gas economy without depending on hybrid technology.</p>
<h2>Honda Civic CRX HF</h2>
<p>Engine: 4 cylinder; 1.5 liter</p>
<p>This is a two-seat version of the Honda Civic, it’s the base model of the CRX line-up, was created for the purpose of fuel economy. When it was new in the market, the car boasted EPA-rated 57 mpg highway mileage, but testing procedures that were done later in 2008 lowered that figure.</p>
<h2>Honda Civic Hybrid</h2>
<p>Engine: 4 cylinder; 1.5-liter (Hybrid)</p>
<p>The new <a href="http://usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/cars-trucks/Honda_Civic-Hybrid/2012/">Civic Hybrid</a> is a safer and heavier car than the old CRX HF. It has back seats, which make it more practical too. All the extra weight means that it needs to rely on Honda&#8217;s hybrid system to reduce fuel economy close to what the older car got.</p>
<h2>Honda Civic VX Hatchback</h2>
<p>Engine: 4 cylinder; 1.5 liter</p>
<p>Honda dominates this list partly because there are so many different versions of the Civic that each qualifies for a separate inclusion. The EPA listed only one model name unless the model was redesigned into a different size class.</p>
<h2>Toyota Prius v</h2>
<p>Engine: 4 Cylinder; 1.9 liter (hybrid)</p>
<p>The Toyota Prius v adds extra cargo room and sliding back seats compared to the &#8220;regular&#8221; Prius for greater cargo space and flexibility. For the record, it&#8217;s pronounced as &#8220;vee,&#8221; and not &#8220;five.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Lexus CT200h</h2>
<p>Engine: 4 Cylinder; 1.8 liter</p>
<p>The CT200h is the second hybrid-only model for Lexus. This one is tuned for more responsive driving but still delivers, decent fuel economy.</p>
<h2>Ford Escape Hybrid 4WD</h2>
<p>Engine: 2.3 Liter</p>
<p>Cynics are often forgiven if they’re shocked to learn that the sixth <a href="http://www.greencarreports.com/review/1018884_ford-escape-hybrid-limited-4wd-review-and-test-drive">most fuel-efficient 2008 vehicle in the U.S</a>. is an SUV from Ford. They manufacture a good-looking sport-Ute that can be used in the city. For all the cynics out there or people who want to take baby steps into this hybrid life with a ride that looks pretty much familiar, this vehicle may be your answer.</p>
<h2>The Volkswagen XL1</h2>
<p>The Volkswagen are now selling the world’s <a href="http://blog.carzoos.com.au/2014/08/the-volkswagen-xl1-truly-unique-in-look.html">most fuel-efficient production car</a>, which can go for a staggering 313 miles per gallon.</p>
<p>This car can go from 0-60mph in just 11.9 seconds, and there are just 200 of this type of cars on sale as they were hand crafted.</p>
<h2>Nissan Altima Hybrid</h2>
<p>Engine: 4 Cylinder; 2.5 liter</p>
<p>Nissan purchased the rights to Toyota&#8217;s Hybrid Synergy Drive which resulted in the Nissan Altima Hybrid. A car that combined the fuel-saving and high-tech benefits of Toyota&#8217;s hybrid technology with the Altima&#8217;s driving dynamics and sporty looks.</p>
<p>In conclusion, environment-friendly vehicles are produced in minimal numbers as they are handcrafted. But the importance of their creation cannot be overstated, I wonder why we do not focus on creating more. This is because can be able to conserve our environment by using these vehicles while still fulfilling the day to day activities.</p>

		<p>You have heard the saying: “It is always darkest just before dawn.” That applies to many aspects of the United States economy. While the country is still struggling to pull out of the recent economic fiasco, there are current opportunities for people to enhance the quality of their lives by purchasing homes, automobiles, and other items with record low interest rates. Making the most of opportunities and deals requires you do some research and remain in control throughout your shopping and buying experience.</p>
<p>Know your options</p>
<p>Practically all car purchases that are financed use one of two methods: Direct lending or dealership financing.</p>
<p>On the spot financing</p>
<p>Financing from the car dealer is frequently used because of enticing advertisements that are worded in such a way as to make people believe the car dealer is able to offer special financing that is not available elsewhere. Ads will tell people that “nobody gets turned down,” and “good credit, bad credit, no credit. All are approved.” It is also very convenient to arrange for financing at the same location where you buy your vehicle. Loan officers are available on weekends and evenings. They can be taking care of paperwork while you browse and test drive cars. Dealerships work with a wide variety of lenders and know which lender specializes in making loans to people with bad or slow credit.</p>
<p>The Federal Trade Commission (https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0056-understanding-vehicle-financing#fin) urges you to shop around before choosing any financing offered to you. While the dealership may enter into a contract with you about financing your purchase, they almost always sell the note to a bank, finance company, or other assignee. The car dealer is looking to make money at every opportunity. By adding them as a middleman to your financing equation, you may be adding finance charges that would not be there if you went directly to the source of the loan.</p>
<p>Direct lenders</p>
<p>Working with a direct lender for your automobile loan is not much different than working with a loan officer at the dealership. You are still qualified based on credit history, income, and current debts. By knowing your credit terms and payments in advance, you are less at the mercy of the car salesperson and dealership staff. You know what car you can afford and do not have to worry about them telling you that “special financing” is not available on the car you really want. Companies that buy used cars also simplify negotiations by eliminating any trade-in confusion or haggling.</p>
<p>The more research and leg work you do prior to going to the car lot, the less dependent you are on the dealership and the salesperson. You can arrive knowing exactly how much you are willing to pay for the vehicle of your choice. You are able to establish very quickly that you are a serious buyer and not just someone browsing. You are able to keep the conversation and focus on one thing – the price of the vehicle you want. If they are not able or willing to meet your terms, you can walk away with a minimal investment of time in the process. You are the one in control of the negotiation.</p>

		<p>While opting for finances for your car, it is important to choose an appropriate lending option. Often there are confusions regarding, whether to go for direct lending options or for the dealership financing. Both of these have their individual advantages and lacunas. However, as per the financial advisors, the direct dealing options turns out to be better of the two as you will be charges a low rate of interest and flexible loan term. Finance institutes like credit unions, banks and other financial companies provide these finances. The nature of the loan is such that you need to pay the interest rate, the balance amount and also a fee levied on the loan amount.</p>
<p><strong>Scope of interaction with lenders</strong><br />
These lenders provide attractive offers related to interest rate, loan term and the monthly installment. The rate of interest charges by these lenders can vary, so it is important to do some amount of homework regarding the same as it ensures that you will get a competitive rate of interest. In direct lending, you have the scope of shopping around for the loan. You can interact directly with lenders and get in depth information about different features of the loan for the car that you intend to buy.</p>
<p><strong>Pay directly to lenders</strong><br />
Another important aspect of direct lending is that you can know the terms of the loan well in advance. The loan term, rate of interest, monthly payment and additional fees are informed to the applicant during the phase of comparing the loan. If the loan suits your budget, you need to sign a contract or agreement with the lender citing the terms and features. After you have decided on the car, the proceeds from the banks, credit unions or companies go to the dealers directly for purchasing the car. In this case, lenders possess the lien of your car, till you have paid the loan amount in full.</p>
<p><strong>Avail attractive deals</strong><br />
Generally, the duration of these loans range in between thirty six months and ninety six months, depending on the principal amount. With a lengthy loan term, you can lower the amount paid through monthly payments, but a high rate of interest will be levied on you. These terms solely depends on your credit history and credit score. With a good credit score, you can secure a good loan amount and interest rate. Few lenders also have the provision of discounts on loans, for the convenience of the borrowers. The monthly installment that you need to pay is deducted directly from your checking account.</p>
<p><strong>Secure funds early</strong><br />
For an informed shopper, the first step of acquiring finances is to secure the availability of funds first. With a clear projection of the loan amount, interest rate, loan term and monthly installment. In case of dealer financing, you fail to get the exact loan amount as the dealers levy additional charges on the loan amount and ultimately you need to pay exorbitant amounts. On the other hand, if you opt for direct financing them you need not pay extra charges and you can save some money. So, if you are considering to obtain cash for junk cars or for the new one ones, the direct lenders are a good option to look for.</p>
<p><strong>Important factors to consider</strong><br />
Irrespective of the lending option that you have opted for, there are few factors that you need to consider prior to the purchase of the car. First is the Federal law that is applicable to the lending process. They give you the power to negotiate with the lender and strike a favorable deal. Next is the calculation of your financial condition to determine the amount that you can afford. Calculate the price of the car, and then determine the loan amount and the monthly installment that will fit your budget.</p>
<p>Author Bio: Elizabeth Sullivan had bought a car of late and here she has emphasized the advantages of direct lending over the dealership financing. These direct lenders also provide cash for junk cars for the convenience of car buyers.</p>

		<p>If you want to drive in style and comfort made even better with a luxurious leather-clad interior, then a high class SUV is the way to go. We have created a list of the top five luxury SUVs that will help to turn your uncomfortable city drives into a spa-esque driving experience. All that while allowing you to drive off-road whenever the whim takes you and still giving you plenty of room for the kids, the dog and your golf clubs.</p>
<p>Before you begin shopping, it is important to research new and used car prices to ensure you know how much you should be paying for your luxury SUV.</p>
<p>Number 1: The Range Rover Evoque SD4 Dynamic Auto</p>
<p>According to Jeremy Clarkson and his team of car-buffs on Top Gear this luxury SUV is the best on the market. It handles perfectly on windy country roads and provides city slickers with a fashionable way to tackle the streets of a busy neon jungle. Being the smaller sister of one of the classiest rides out there, the Evoque SD4 Dynamic Auto offers drivers an effortless sense of style making it the number one luxury SUV on the market today.</p>
<p>Number 2: Porsche Cayenne Diesel</p>
<p>While this luxury SUV can off-road, its best performance is on the road with speeds of 62mph being reached in a little over four seconds, making it an athletic 4×4. The handling is precise with its smooth steering features and this ride is made even more appealing with its roomy interior. </p>
<p><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7081/7063071257_cf1a8ce7b8_n.jpg" alt="https://www.flickr.com/photos/markfaviell/7063071257" class="" height="171" width="320"><br />
<figcaption class="caption wp-caption-text">https://www.flickr.com/photos/markfaviell/7063071257</figcaption>
<p>Number 3: BMW X5</p>
<p>The eight-speed automatic transmission coupled with 18″ aluminium wheels as standard on this BMW ensures that the car has the power and the agility to take you on a graceful ride on all kinds of surfaces. The driveline traction control is a popular addition and the ABS provides drivers with a ride that feels safe yet powerful.</p>
<p>Number 4: Lexus LX 570</p>
<p>This Lexus is famous for its immaculate cabin, sturdy off-road driving abilities and pure power provided by its impressive V8 engine. Passing effortlessly on fast sections of road is as easy as maneuvering into tight spaces and it offers the perfect combination of brute force and refinement. American business magazine Forbes recently reviewed the LX 570 and praised the vehicle for its ability to evolve over the years into one of the best luxury SUVs available today.</p>
<p>Number 5: Jeep Grand Cherokee</p>
<p>The 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee is equal in its beauty as it is in its driving abilities and just because this is a sexy ride, it doesn’t mean that it doesn’t drive like a beast. This car has the perfect mix of chic lines and unadulterated power, and add some luxury wood and leather into the interior and you have yourself one fine luxury SUV.</p>
<p>Find out more about any of the cars featured in this list by doing some online research and asking for advice from local dealers.</p>
<p>It is imperative to take a luxury SUV on a test drive before you buy it to check everything from the handling to the comfort of the interior for yourself.</p>

		<p><strong>Need for tactics</strong><br />
Although the average driver will have a developed style of driving, it is important to think about dangerous situations and how to avoid them. In order to be good at assessing and avoiding potentially dangerous situations, it is good to develop tactical driving. However, in theory it will be easy to master the necessary skills required to perform the required actions, but in practice it will be harder; which is why it is important to look into practicing when possible.</p>
<p><strong>What you drive?</strong><br />
Not all tactical approaches are great in all situations as you have to account for the type of transmission you have in your car. Moreover, it is not the same if you drive a FWD, RWD or AWD. Nevertheless, it is not the type of drive you have in your car, it is whether you know the characteristics of your vehicle; and it is crucial as you will have to react in certain boundaries in a split-second.</p>
<p><strong>Staying alert</strong><br />
In order to fully assess any situation and to react appropriately without endangering yourself and the others on the road, it is important to stay vigilant and to be aware of your surroundings. Do not assume anything and avoid hoping that someone will react in a certain manner. You should rely on what you see and hear, as you should always keep your eyes on the road; even if not paying attention for a second, it is possible to cause a major accident. Remember that people become more alerted when they suffer their first accident, which is why you should be alert at all times to avoid that first time.</p>
<p><strong>Braking is a skill</strong><br />
Even if you are driving a new-generation car with new braking systems, it is not always the same to just simply slam on the brakes and to brake sensibly. Before developing your tactical driving, it is important that you try out the braking system so that you get a grip for how you can best utilize the brakes without endangering anyone on the road.</p>
<p><strong>Proper car handling</strong><br />
In certain situations it will be possible that your car we go into a hard swerve or if you lose control over your car, and in these situations you will need to react fast. Maintaining your cool when trying to straighten your car is not easy, but it will require you to stay calm and to act quickly. A way to improve your self-confidence is to <a href="https://www.ltrent.com.au/driving-lessons/lesson-types" title="Proper car handling" target="_blank">get some more driver training</a> if you feel that you need to improve your driving skills further, or if you feel that a little boost in your skills will help you out.</p>
<p><strong>Technical driving</strong><br />
You should be always prepared for the worst as it is better to think ahead and to figure out a way to avoid if anything might go wrong before anything happens. It is best to try and to practice driving in stressful situations so that you can keep your calm, and to find a course and driving school that will help you master the necessary skills to avoid dangerous situations. Remember that finding your own tactics for driving is key as you will have your own style and you should only implement new ideas.</p>

<div id="article-content">
<p>This could be the most talked about maneuver amongst new drivers and their biggest fear, when it comes to driving. I have heard of stories how drivers elect to park one or two blocks away to avoid parking between two cars.</p>
<p>The most important thing to consider when attempting a park between two vehicles is safety first.</p>
<p>Approaching a vehicle ahead of you, parked on the side of the roadway should be done and planned well in advance. The beginning of the maneuver should start far enough back. If the roadway is wide enough, check you&#8217;re mirrors, touch you&#8217;re brake pedal to warn other drivers that you are slowing down and stopping. Signal to the right, assuming we are parking on the right. Check you&#8217;re right shoulder, keeping the steering wheel straight. Once everything is safe, gradually move over, and drive in a straight line alongside the vehicles you&#8217;re planning to park between. Do not attempt to move in at the last minute, towards the vehicle. You should be planning this far enough back to swing in sooner, so you will be going straight along side the vehicle, as you approach the vehicle in front of you. You should have a minimum of a couple of feet clearance.</p>
<p>As you pull along side the spot that you are attempting to park, pause, and make a decision on the size of area. This decision should only take a couple of seconds. Is it big enough for you&#8217;re vehicle? You should have a few feet extra on both ends of the car. You have to leave enough room for other drivers that may attempt to back up, if they have to clear the vehicle in front of their car, to get out. Once you have made the decision that the area that you are going to park is big enough. Continue straight ahead, and stop, when you are parallel to the vehicle you are going to park behind, and change gears to reverse.</p>
<p>Look out the back passenger window and check if you can see the tail end corner of the vehicle, you are parking beside. If you can see it, this is you&#8217;re turning point. If not, check you&#8217;re left shoulder for pedestrians. You shouldn&#8217;t have to worry about traffic at this point. You&#8217;re front end is not swinging out. Only when it is safe, roll straight back, looking out the back passenger window, and stop when it comes into view. By doing this, you&#8217;re vehicle front end should clear the car in front of you, but you still have to check to make sure, when you swing in. It will not work if you&#8217;re only a couple inches away from vehicle you&#8217;re beside. You need to be two or three feet away.</p>
<p>Now is the time to make the maneuver into the parking spot. First we have to do some safety procedures. Check you&#8217;re mirrors for vehicles and cyclist coming up behind you. Check you&#8217;re blind spot just in case there is someone coming across, from you&#8217;re left side. If you&#8217;re back end is going to swing into the parking spot, the front end is going to swing out, further into the roadway.</p>
<p>Once the safety checks are all done, and you can see the tail end of the vehicle beside you. Move in slowly with you&#8217;re foot covering the break only to ease up to get the vehicle rolling, and pushing down to slow the vehicle. Use the gas pedal only to get it rolling if you have to, but make sure you are covering the break during the majority of this maneuver. You should be looking out the back window and watch the curb of the sidewalk slowly disappear along the tail end of you&#8217;re vehicle. It&#8217;ll slowly disappear from the left side to the right side. Once you think you cannot see it on the back corner of you&#8217;re side, behind you, pause and gradually turn the wheel the other way. The faster it disappears, the faster you have to turn the steering wheel. Once it is all gone along the tail end and corner of vehicle, the steering wheel should be turned all the way the other way at this point, before you roll back any further. Make sure you glance forward as you&#8217;re front end swings in to make sure the front end of you&#8217;re vehicle is clear of the vehicle in front of you. Once you know the front is clear, continue to look back until the vehicle is stopped.</p>
<p>Change gears and move forward with you&#8217;re foot on the break, keeping in mind, the wheels of the car is turned out towards the roadway. Straighten the front end of the vehicle and the wheels of you&#8217;re vehicle. If you are not sure of the direction of where the wheels are turned, slowly release the break and watch your front end roll and correct accordingly. (Check driving manual for wheel alignment when parking on a hill.)</p>
<p>This driving technique has worked for my students in the past, and I still use it. Vehicles have changed over the years, and it is harder to see the back end of the vehicle. Please consult with a family member, and or recognized driving school for further instructions on parallel parking.</p>
