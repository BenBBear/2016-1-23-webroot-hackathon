The references had been very positive as to the service they received from Magnolia.</font><br /><br /><font size="2">Ms Vela gave a presentation on the services provided by Magnolia. &nbsp;Ms Vela stated that they currently provide management services for 43 HOA/Condo properties. The services provided by Magnolia are fairly standard and can be&nbsp;</font><br /><font size="2">specialized to an individual properties requirements.</font><br /><br /><font size="2">Ms Diane Williams inquired as to what sort of properties were managed by Magnolia, Ms Vela replied as to a range of properties like ours, single family residences and also multifamily properties.&nbsp;</font><br /><br /><font size="2">A question was addressed to the Board, how many paying properties in the HOA, 296. Further questions were deferred as Ms Vela was present for only a short time and the questions to the board would be addressed later in the meeting.</font><br /><font size="2">&nbsp;</font><br /><font size="2">Mr. Leonel Cantu addressed a question to Ms Vela regarding delays in obtaining a resale certificate on a property he was selling. &nbsp;Ms Vela agreed to look into the matter. &nbsp;</font><br /><br /><font size="2">Question regards Resale Certificate 34-7, Ms Vela stated the cost was $200.00 and the expense was to the Seller or Buyer as per their negotiated sales contract. &nbsp;</font><br /><font size="2">Question how much will the management contract cost the HOAs, about $929.00 per month. &nbsp; Note: the HOA has not commited to or signed any contract with Magnolia, we are in an exploratory stage and are open to other &nbsp;management companies.</font><br /><font size="2">A member from the floor pointed out that some services provided by Magnolia are provided by the city of Mission. &nbsp;Ms Vela agreed.</font><br /><font size="2">Diane Shaffer questioned the $200.00 certificate fee.</font><br /><font size="2">Bev Millar stated that in her opinion the Board did not want to do the work and just wanted to hand the job over to someone else.</font><br /><font size="2">Ms Vela was thanked for her presentation and excused from the meeting.</font><font size="2">&nbsp;</font><br /><font size="2">Dick Schulte assumed the chair and gave a presentation on why the Board thinks &nbsp; the HOA should have a Professional Property Manager. &nbsp;Mr Schulte pointed out that the scope and labor involved with managing the HOA is becoming too much for unpaid Volunteers. &nbsp;The legal aspects &nbsp;have changed as shown by new HOA regulations &nbsp;by the state of Texas in 2012, and nearly impossible for the volunteer Board to keep current with changes.. &nbsp;</font><br /><font size="2">Mr. Schulte pointed out that the Board was asking for a rate increase of $3.33 per month per lot to facilitate hiring a professional management company. Beyond that Mr. Schulte pointed out we are considering a one year renewable contract.</font><br /><font size="2">Mr. Clinton berated the Board as not doing their job and not consulting with the members. &nbsp;</font><br /><font size="2">It was pointed out that the purpose of this meeting was to consult with the members and seek the members approval on a subject that the Board was authorized to do on their own without membership approval.</font><br /><font size="2">Mr. Larry Miller &ndash;Board Member at Large-stood up and challenged Mr. Clinton&rsquo;s &nbsp;remarks..</font><br /><font size="2">Mr. Joe Ertman stood and thanked the Board for standing up and volunteering.</font><br /><font size="2">Mr. Clinton apologised for his hostility.</font><br /><font size="2">Jack Berg stated that he had properties in both phase 1 and 1A and did not see the difference and need for an HOA. &nbsp;</font><br /><font size="2">Mila Kole asked how many other companies had been researched. &nbsp;Mr. Herndier stated that he would cover that in his presentation.</font><font size="2">&nbsp;</font><br /><font size="2">Mr. Skip Matyear gave a presentation on the consequences of disbanding the HOA.</font><br /><font size="2">In his opinion the primary purpose of the HOA is to maintain property values for the residents. &nbsp;The phase 1-a (HOA) &nbsp;has 132 undeveloped properties. &nbsp;He stated that he thinks tonight&rsquo;s vote was to maintain or disband the HOA, which resulted in a reaction from the members. &nbsp;Discussion followed over legal costs and loss of architectural control of the undeveloped properties. &nbsp;The topic of HOA liens was raised by Ms Clinton. &nbsp;There is a disagreement as to whether on not such liens exist. &nbsp;Please refer to (Schedule B item 6.k) in your title papers which give rights to collect assessments.</font><br /><font size="2">Mr. Glen Herndier gave a presentation on the work involved in administration of the HOA by unpaid volunteers. &nbsp;In particular the legal requirements and the need to have someone who knows those requirements and knowledge of changes. This is in addition to maintaining accurate records for residents, dues collections, and By-Law enforcement. &nbsp;Note, the By-Laws do not task the Board to look for infractions but is here to respond to resident complaints. &nbsp;</font><br /><font size="2">Mr. Red Goudge and Mr. Herndier have been actively researching a property management company since the fall of 2114.</font><br /><font size="2">Mr. Herndier and the Board narrowed the current selection to Magnolia after investigating a larger company from Arizona. &nbsp;We relied primarily on the positive feed back from other HOA&rsquo;s in this area. &nbsp;The Board has spent a great deal of time dealing with contract negotiations and following up on references. &nbsp;The references pointed out that Magnolia is local and can be easily contacted; their attorney in San Antonio is very well versed in HOA matters; paper work is very good; &nbsp;financial statements are very thorough and other HOA&rsquo;s are hiring Magnolia. &nbsp; &ldquo;If you do not want to do the work with volunteers then hire managers to do the work&rdquo;. &nbsp;Professional Managers are experts in legal matters. &nbsp;Mr. Herndier stated that Board is recommending Magnolia as our management company, and &nbsp;to do that we need to amend our By-Laws to cover the cost.</font><br /><font size="2">Ms. Williams asked about the Board still being in place in event of a professional management company, yes the Board will remain in place and Magnolia reports to us.</font><br /><font size="2">Mr. Butch Hilderbrand asked about current HOA bank balance, approximately $15,000.00.</font><br /><font size="2">Ms Miller asked why not do a one year trial?</font><br /><font size="2">Mr. Lionel Cantu not happy with Magnolia.			.</font><br /><font size="2">Mr. Herndier was asked to read the By-Law amendment.</font><br /><font size="2">Proposed amended By-Law:</font><br /><font size="2">Articles VIII, Section 5: Dues</font><br /><font size="2">Annual assessment shall be sixty dollars ($60.00) per year per lot and can be changed by an affirmative vote of fifty-one percent (51%) of all members at the annual meeting, or a special meeting properly called.</font><br /><font size="2">Ms Barbara Burke made motion to accept the amendment as presented by the Board, seconded by Lloyd Gath.</font><br /><font size="2">Discussion: &nbsp;Mr. Bud Zimmer asked if the board would continue to have architectural control, yes.</font><br /><font size="2">Joe Ertman moved an amendment to the motion to use current funds to hire Magnolia and increase dues to $60.00 effective January 2017. &nbsp;Amendment failed to pass.</font><br /><font size="2">Vote: Ms Burke&rsquo;s Motion to accept the proposed amendment, -for 124, &nbsp;against 31, abstained 16, &nbsp;Motion passed.</font><br /><font size="2">The Board wishes to express their heart felt thanks to the volunteers Iris Weersma and Wendy Hill who helped with the set up, member voter registration, and the Fall Social registration.</font><br /><font size="2">Meeting adjourned at 8:15pm</font><br /><font size="2">Respectfully Submitted,</font><br /><br /><font size="2">Skip Matyear</font><br /><font size="2">Secretary</font><br /><br /><font size="2">Dick Schulte</font><br /><font size="2">Vice-President</font><br /><br /></h2>

<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:justify;"><font size="3"><strong>H. Jackson Brown, Jr., wrote Life&rsquo;s Little Instruction Book</strong> to provide his son with wisdom he could refer to as he lived his life. In that same spirit, Community Association Institute leaders throughout the years have shared their advice and pearls of wisdom for better community association life. Here then are 130 tips to guide you and to ensure that your community association experience enhances your life and your community.<br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  <strong>Pearls of Wisdom</strong><br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  1.

Pay your assessments&mdash;on time.<br /><span></span>  4. Attend the annual meeting.<br /><span></span>  5. Read the newsletter and the minutes of association meetings.<br /><span></span>  6.
