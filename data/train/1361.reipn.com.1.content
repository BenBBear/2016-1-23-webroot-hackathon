        <h2>Protecting the investor</h2>
        Just as you have a "listing invetory" of properties, you'll have a "buyer inventory" of individuals and the types of property they are looking for.  When you register buyers with our site, their contact details remain hidden.  Only the details on the types of properties they are looking for are searchable and viewable by others - when a seller investor finds your potential buyer, they see your contact details and must contact you, the investor, rather than the buyer directly, to help ensure you don't get cut out of the deal.
       	<p>Likewise, when listing properties, you may choose whether or not to display the property address or just the specs on the property.  Depending on how you own/control the property - you may want every set of eyes possible going directly to the property, but in other cases you'll want potential buyers only gain access to the property through you.  Our site allows you to list your properties either way, you can even mix and match.</p>
        	
      	<h2>More exposure for you via your investor profile page</h2>      
            Investors will be able to create their own individual investor profile page where they can list any pertinant details about themselves and their companies - all information is optional - it is your page, customize it as you wish - some examples:
            <ul>
            	<li>Their property listings - showcase you listing inventory</li>
                <li>Your buyer inventory - let sellers find you</li>
            	<li>Inbound links to their primary website and any other sites they wish - great for SEO</li>
                <li>Completed deals - show your experience and expertise</li>
          	</ul>
