In a study involving nearly 158,000 men and women, they determined that a correlation existed between the consumption of chocolate and a diminished risk of stroke and heart attacks.</p>
<p>While news about incorporating chocolate into the diet is nothing new, many people might be surprised tthat this study found that milk chocolate, which is often considered dark chocolate&#8217;s evil twin, is also healthy. The bottom line is that you shouldn&#8217;t be so quick to pass on chocolate no matter what kind it is. Instead, you can enjoy some on a daily basis just like those in the study did. Compared to those who didn&#8217;t eat any types of chocolate, those who ingested the highest levels of it regularly (with the average being 7g daily) had a 25 percent lower risk of experiencing any cardiovascular disease episode and a 23 percent lower risk of stroke.</p>
<p>Why is milk chocolate also beneficial? The experts suggest that the presence of flavonoids and milk ingredients like fatty acids and calcium play a role.</p>

<p>Despite the wealth of positive media coverage dark chocolate has received for its myriad of health benefits, an article in “USA Today” states more research is needed before you start overindulging on this treat. Chocolate contains large amounts of butter, sugar and cream, which can break your diet. If you rely on the occasional piece of chocolate to alleviate stress or satisfy a craving, that’s fine, but consuming too much can have adverse health effects.</p>

One bar of milk chocolate that has 1.55 ounces or 44 grams, contains 235 calories, 13 grams of fat, 8 of which come from saturated fat, and 221 grams of sugar. One ounce of dark chocolate, or 28.35 grams, contains 156 calories, 9 grams of fat, 5 from saturated fat, and 13 grams of sugar. Saturated fat elevates blood cholesterol, which puts you at risk for heart disease and stroke. The added sugar in chocolate has no nutritional value, which can cause weight gain and heart disease, according to the American Heart Association.

<p data-dmc="summary">In general, babies less than 1 year old should avoid chocolate, particularly, dark and milk chocolate. These contain caffeine-like substances. Caffeine is unsuitable for very small children because of its stimulating effect. As children reach a year old, they can tolerate small amounts of white chocolate, which contains less caffeine. However, even in this case, the high sugar content makes it far from ideal as a baby snack.</p>
<section class="article-section">
<h2 class="header"><span data-dmc="section-headline">Digestion</span></h2>
<p data-dmc="section">Babies are designed to take in breast milk or formula for the first four to six months of life. A baby&#8217;s digestive system can&#8217;t handle solid foods, including chocolate, for up to six months. You may find that even after that, it takes several months to wean your baby onto mashed solids. Babies generally start out on wet cereal and move to pureed vegetables and eventually to pureed meats and mashed foods. This process may last another six months and more. Chocolate doesn&#8217;t feature as a recommended stage in introducing your baby to solid foods.</p>
<h2 class="header"><span data-dmc="section-headline">Caffeine</span></h2>
<p data-dmc="section">Though no evidence appears to link moderate caffeine consumption in children with serious long-term complications, you should avoid giving caffeine products to babies.</p></h></h></section>

<p>75 calories</p>
<p>This treat involves chocolate so you still get that chocolaty taste, but by combining it with the healthy, low fat banana you are likely to eat less actual chocolate.  The banana also provides important vitamins and minerals such as potassium and adds fibre and bulk to your snack, meaning it will keep you feeling satisfied for longer.  As an added bonus frozen banana tastes just like banana ice cream.</p>
<p><strong>2. Hot cocoa</strong></p>

<p>Another way to get that chocolaty flavour without the fat and calories, this drink also provides a good dose of calcium for strong bones and protein to keep you full.  That’s a lot more than a Hershey’s bar will give you.  If you find the cocoa a little bitter add artificial sweeteners to taste.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Chocolate has been enjoyed for centuries and used to cure many illnesses. Cocoa is grown in tropical countries and can be eaten as raw cacao, hot chocolate, candy and baked goods. Purchasing chocolate that is organic and certified fair trade ensures ethical treatment of cocoa producers plus higher nutritional content.</p>
<h1>Medicinal uses of chocolate through the centuries</h1>
<p>The medicinal use of cocoa in North America and Europe dates back to the 16th century. Scholars have discovered that, for hundreds of years, the beverage called chocolate was administered to sick patients and used to prevent illness. Beginning in the 1500s, there is documented use of cacao to treat fatigue, fever, emaciation, exhaustion, poor bowel function, anemia, kidney stones and tuberculosis.</p>
<h1>Recent discoveries of cocoa health benefits</h1>
<p>The recent discovery of the beneficial phenolic compounds in cocoa has created tremendous interest in cocoa&#8217;s health benefits. Cocoa has been touted for its great antioxidant powers, along with its potential to help with blood pressure, atherosclerosis, and aging. A search of pub med reveals thousands of studies on cocoa&#8217;s healing powers.</p>
<p>Hundreds of chemical compounds exist in cacao including alkaloids and flavonoids. One alkaloid, theobromine, works as a mood enhancer and lowers blood pressure. Cocoa also provides nutritious magnesium,</p></h></h>

<p>be believed, the last thing you should feel when you secretly tuck into hunk</p>
<p>of chocolate is guilty.</p>
<p>Scientists have revealed that eating chocolate &#8211; in reasonable</p>
<p>amounts &#8211; makes you feel emotionally better and so improves the smooth</p>
<p>running of your body&#8217;s endorphins. It even protects against heart disease. So</p>

<p>occasionally, indulge in a sweet treat&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Chocolate makes you live longer</b> Researchers at Harvard University in the U.S. studied 8,000 men for 65 years</p>
<p>and found that those who ate modest amounts of chocolate up to three times a</p>
<p>month, lived almost a year longer than those who didn&#8217;t eat any.</p>
<p>They concluded that this is likely to be due to the fact that cocoa contains</p>
<p>antioxidants called polyphenols, also found in red wine, which prevent the</p>
<p>oxidation of harmful cholesterol.</p>
<p>Antioxidants are also known to protect against cancer.</p>
<p><b>Chocolate is good for stress</b> This is thought to be because it contains valeric acid, which is a relaxant</p>
<p>and tranquilliser.</p>
<p>Also, the sugar in chocolate may reduce stress &#8211; sugar has been shown to</p>

		<p data-dmc="summary">Chocolate, derived from the cacao bean, has many beneficial compounds that can contribute to good health. The addition of ingredients in the manufacturing of milk chocolate candy, however, decreases the nutritional value of chocolate and makes this food less healthy than its dark chocolate relative. Learning more about milk chocolate and what it contains may motivate you to choose alternative treats or to switch to dark chocolate, which can be lower in fat, calories and sugar.</p>
<section class="article-section">
<h2 class="header"><span data-dmc="section-headline">Calories</span></h2>
<p data-dmc="section">It is important to pay attention to your caloric intake, because consuming too many calories can lead to an unhealthy weight gain. Foods high in calories can have a place in your healthy diet, as long as they are eaten in small amounts on an occasional basis. The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute website adds that the weight gain that can accompany a high-calorie diet may also contribute to heart disease, diabetes and high-blood pressure. Milk chocolate is one of these foods that is not considered healthy because of the number of calories a small serving contains. A 1.5-ounce milk chocolate bar has 235 calories.</p>

		<p><strong>Chocolate Contains Antioxidants that May Ward Off Cancer</strong><br />
Is chocolate actually good for us? The jury’s still out, but it might be. Chocolate is derived from cocoa beans, which are also rich in flavonoids&#8211;a family of substances that act as antioxidants. These may protect our cells from oxidative damage. It’s a widespread belief that free radicals, which are formed from the oxidation process, have the ability to alter cells’ DNA, transforming them into cancerous cells. Antioxidants help by sweeping up the free radicals, preventing this type of damage from occurring.</p>
<p><strong>The Research Study that Makes Chocolate Seem Even More Appealing</strong><br />
Researchers from the Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center at Georgetown University honed in on a substance in cocoa known as pentameric procyanidin (pentamer) that may exude promising antioxidant capabilities. In the lab, Robert B. Dickson, PhD and his team isolated pentamer and tested it on breast cancer cells to see how they would react. They found that pentamer compounds were able to deactivate certain proteins in the cancer cells, preventing them from dividing further. Although this study is indeed promising, it is unknown if this phenomenon could be replicated in human studies. This preliminary research study-one of several to follow-was funded by</p>

		<p>There is some good news for the chocolate lovers out there: a new study carried out by researchers from Northern Arizona University reveals that the intake of dark chocolate with at least 60 percent cacao could be the key to improving attention and alertness and get you through the afternoon slump.</p>
<p>&#8220;Chocolate is indeed a stimulant and it activates the brain in a really special way,&#8221; said Dr. Larry Stevens, a professor of psychological sciences at Northern Arizona University. &#8220;It can increase brain characteristics of attention, and it also significantly affects blood pressure levels.&#8221;</p>
<p>The study was published in the journal <i>NeuroRegulation</i> and sponsored by American chocolate manufacturer the Hershey Company. The study is actually the first of its kind to investigate the influence that chocolate has on brain activity and attention using the electroencephalography (EEG) technique. With EEG, it is possible to take images of the brain&#8217;s activity while performing cognitive tasks.</p>
<p>For the study, Stevens and his team recruited 122 volunteers aged between 18 and 25. They were all given one of the following options: chocolate with high cacao content (60 percent), chocolate with low cacao content (0 percent), high cacao chocolate with added L-theanine (the amino acid found in green</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There seems to be great reasons why pregnant women should treat themselves with chocolate. This is because these luscious treats are found to improve a pregnant woman&#8217;s condition by preventing certain complications including pre-eclampsia. According to studies, chocolate can not only relieve a pregnant woman&#8217;s stress levels but also makes happier babies.</p>
<p><strong>Dark chocolate can help prevent pre-eclampsia</strong></p>
<p>Pre-eclampsia is one among many causes of premature birth which also claims the lives of many babies. This condition occurs in pregnant women and is often characterized by high blood pressure. When a pregnant woman&#8217;s blood pressure rises, this can lead to convulsions. It may also lead to blood clotting as well as cause damage in the liver. In some cases, pre-eclampsia may also cause the kidneys to fail from functioning.</p>
<p>According to the reports from the <i>Annals of Epidemiology</i> however, the theobromine content in cocoa can help prevent the condition. Research from <i>Yale University</i> concludes after questioning dietary habits of 2,500 pregnant women that those who eat chocolate regularly are 50 percent less likely to suffer from pre-eclampsia during the pregnancy.</p>
<p><strong>Chocolate aids in proper blood pressure regulation</strong></p>

		<p>Cacao has been a super food secret that&#8217;s been revealed more and more lately. Cacao is the essential ingredient of chocolate. It can be purchased as a powder or nibs and mixed into coffee or milk to get the maximum polyphenol flavonoids that offer many health benefits.</p>
<p>But don&#8217;t let this lure you into eating all sorts of chocolate candies. The more cacao is processed into consumer chocolate candies, the less healthy and even potentially unhealthy the end product becomes.</p>
<p>In order to obtain maximum health benefits, use either cacao powder and nibs or the darkest organic fair trade chocolate bars you can find. It&#8217;s recommended to get chocolate that&#8217;s <i>at least 70 percent</i> cacao without milk and with very little sugar. You&#8217;ll have to get used to the bitter or bittersweet taste, which is not so difficult.</p>
<p>Processed milks and sugars will not make you healthier. But what&#8217;s cool is it only takes 200 mg of cacao daily, which equates to 10 grams of dark chocolate or 2.5 grams of high-flavonol cacao powder as part of a balanced diet. <b>That&#8217;s <i>less</i> than an ounce.</b> Less than a daily ounce can improve cardiovascular health and reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes.</p>

<p class="mol-para-with-font"><span id="ext-gen101">The reason for this is flavonoids — a type of antioxidant found in chocolate, tea and red wine, which can help stimulate blood flow by mopping up damaging substances called free radicals, which can cause disease.</span></p>

<p data-dmc="section">Antioxidant flavonoids, present in healthy dark chocolate, have been found by researchers to positively impact cardiovascular health when introduced into the diet. You may have heard that flavonoid-rich chocolate is good for you, but wonder which types of chocolate are best. Some brands and types of chocolate actually remove these positive nutrients.</p>
<p>The highest flavonoid content, according to the Mayo Clinic, is in the darkest of chocolates. Manufacturers of natural chocolates would add to that criteria an absence of heat refinement. Still, a rule of thumb that holds true is that the greater the percentage of cocoa (cacao), the greater flavonoid content possible. The highest percentages of cocoa are found first in dark chocolate and then in milk chocolate. The exception is white chocolate; its processing removes all flavonoids.</p>

		<p>Mention chocolate to anyone, especially during the holidays, and they are all ears. Nothing seems to bring on such a feeling of mental euphoria than a good dose of chocolate. However, the benefits of chocolate are hit and miss depending on the source, additives, and processing.</p>
<p>This is why a high quality source of chocolate in the form raw cacao is very important, as it can bring the freshness and health benefits of chocolate products, without the drawbacks.</p>
<p><strong>Raw versus processed cacao</strong></p>
<p>When you are consuming most chocolate products, they have gone through high heat processing that destroys the majority of the cacao&#8217;s nutrients. In comparison, raw cacao is subjected to very low heat in order to separate the seeds from the cacao bean and is then cold pressed, which leaves the majority of its nutrients intact.</p>
<p>When comparing the antioxidant (ORAC) values of raw cacao powder and processed or roasted cacao powder, the difference is significant and in favor of the raw cacao. Therefore, choosing raw results in higher levels of nutrients and benefits, which is a direct benefit to you.</p>
<p><strong>Healing benefits of cacao</strong></p>
<p>Called &#8220;black gold&#8221; by the Spanish, cacao has been considered a beneficial medicine as it contains over 300 identifiable chemical</p>

Considered a gift from their gods, the natives used it in rituals, and extolled its virtues in hieroglyphs, songs, and drawings. The pre-Olmec peoples, the Olmec, the Mayas, and the Aztec all used cacao in their diets and rituals, mostly for their elite. Archeologists have found numerous ceramic and stone vessels with trace amounts of cacao alkaloids dating as far back as 1900 BC.</p>
<p>Most cacao today is cultivated from the theobroma cacao species. It is a beautiful, delicate-looking evergreen tree that grows in the protection of the understory of the rainforest, thriving in wet and humid climate. Less than 10 percent of the tiny, delicate, pinkish-white blossoms will mature into fruit each growing season, starting around the tree&#8217;s fourth or fifth year. The fruit looks somewhat like an elongated melon with tapered ends. With shallow roots and thin bark, harvesting is not easy. The pods have a woody shell, with a husk and white fruit pulp inside. The ancient peoples used these parts, but today they are discarded for the</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Are you a chocoholic? Everyone likes a sweet treat once in a while. But if you can&#8217;t get through the day without a chocolate fix, it&#8217;s possible that you have a problem. Even someone with the sweetest tooth can overcome it. This article will help you to identify if you have a chocolate addiction and help you to do something about it.</p>
<div class="step_num">1. <b class="whb">Identify the symptoms.</b> Not all researchers in the field of psychology perceive chocolate addiction as a &#8220;true addiction&#8221;,. However, some researchers believe that the release of endorphins brought about by consuming chocolate creates a physical dependency to obtain that mood high again and again, thereby suggesting it is possible to be addicted to chocolate. Any way you look at it, your addiction to chocolate is definitely real and very hard to resist if you have become accustomed to consuming it. If you have uncontrollable cravings for chocolate, these may be some of the signs:</p>
<ul>
<li>You feel &#8220;conditioned&#8221; to need it at certain times of the day (the post-lunch afternoon dip being one good example).</li>
<li>You salivate more in the presence of chocolate, or at the thought of it.</li>
<li>You feel negative or anxious without it, and feel better for having it.</li>
</ul>

		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There is little doubt that the gradual decline in memory and cognitive function that can be the first signs of impending dementia and Alzheimer&#8217;s disease is one of the most serious health problems facing millions of aging adults in most western societies. What is even more staggering is that many people view this potentially fatal decline as acceptable, in spite of the well documented nutritional and scientific studies showing that many memory lapses are not considered a normal part of aging and can be prevented by adopting healthy lifestyle practices at any age.</p>
<p>A team of research scientists from the Harvard Medical School, publishing the results of a study in the journal <i>Neurology</i> have found that drinking two cups of hot chocolate a day may keep the brain healthy and prevent memory decline in older people by preserving blood flow in working areas of the brain. The researchers were working to analyze the effect of cocoa consumption on thinking and memory performance, as well as something called neurovascular coupling, where blood flow in the brain changes in response to local brain activity.</p>

<div class="field-deck">Butter moves from nutty and brown to bitter and burned quickly, so be sure to take the pan off the heat once it turns amber-brown. To keep cookies from spreading, make sure the cookie sheet is completely cool before starting the next batch.</div>
