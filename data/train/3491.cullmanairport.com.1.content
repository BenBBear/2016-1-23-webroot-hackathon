					<h2><a href="http://www.cullmanairport.com/how-mergers-and-acquisitions-are-changing-businesses-in-2015/">How Mergers and Acquisitions are Changing Businesses in 2015</a></h2>
					<br />

			<p>Fiscal crises are considered the precursor of great economic changes. The Great Depression in the 1920s, for instance, paved the way on our higher understanding of macroeconomics. Just like almost all economic innovations, mergers and acquisitions are also products of financial hardships. Mergers are business transactions when two companies (typically of same size) decide to create a new entity which will be managed by both. Acquisitions, on the other hand, are buyouts where one company takes over another. Although different in forms, they have the same business objectives: to win over market challenges and establish stronger market foothold.</p>
<p>According to the website of the <a href="http://www.amlawglobal.com/">AmLaw Group Law Firm</a>, apart from filing for bankruptcy, struggling businesses owners may consider mergers and acquisitions as their primary options in saving their enterprises. On the other hand, some choose to have their business re-financed by foreign investors. In the U.S., for instance, there are some investors who are ready to immigrate in the country to invest in troubled businesses.</p>
<p>To let you see how mergers and acquisitions can powerfully change today’s business landscape, here are some of the most influential M&amp;A deal ever conceived in 2015:</p>
<p>P&amp;G-Coty Inc. mega-merger</p>
<p>In July, reports emerged about P&amp;G planning to sell many of its hair care, cosmetic brands, and fragrance to Coty Inc. The move was strategic because P&amp;G was able to focus more on their advantage (consumer products) while letting an industry leader take care of its beauty business.</p>
<p>CVS-Target pharmacy acquisition</p>
<p>Also in July, America’s largest dispenser of prescription drugs, CVS, agreed to buy Target’s pharmacy business for about $1.9 billion. If approved, the deal will be mutually beneficial for both parties: CVS will be able to expand its pharmaceutical portfolio while Target will be able to channel its efforts on areas they know best.</p>
<p>Holcim and Lafarge power-merger</p>
<p>On April last year, two of the biggest cement, aggregates and concrete manufacturers in the world decided to enter a power-merger. In July this year, the merger was approved, forming a single business entity called LafargeHolcim, which claims to be the biggest in the world.</p>

					<h2><a href="http://www.cullmanairport.com/drug-trafficking-and-other-drug-related-crimes/">Drug Trafficking and Other Drug-related Crimes</a></h2>
					<br />

			<p>More than 30,000 arrests are made by the <a href="http://www.dea.gov/index.shtml">US Drug Enforcement Agency</a> (DEA) every year, all these on drug-related crimes alone. Despite such, as well as the continuous surveillance and operations of law enforcement agencies to bust criminals and free the streets of drugs, trafficking, distribution, possession and use of illegal narcotics (like cocaine, heroin, marijuana and 3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) otherwise known as Ecstasy) are still significant problems in the country.</p>
<p>Many non-violent individuals suffer years of jail term due to the very wrong thought that smuggling drugs into the US is too easy money to pass up. Obviously, they willingly take the risk of being caught and being made to face heavy penalties in exchange for the big amount of cash they will get in return.</p>
<p>A drug-related activity, most especially drug trafficking, is a serious federal crime with harsh mandatory sentences. For possession of drugs, for instance, most states carry a mandatory minimum sentence of 30 to 40 months imprisonment plus steep fines (other states also include many hours of community service, which will serve as additional penance for the crime).</p>
<p>For drug selling, offenders will face much harsher penalties, including three to nine years imprisonment (even longer for those found guilty of selling drugs to minors). The law firm <a href="http://www.kohlerandhart.com/appleton/">Kohler &amp; Hart, SC</a>, explains on its website the gravity of drug-related offenses and the penalties these carry, especially the penalties for drug trafficking, which include: years of jail sentence; fine amounting to thousands of dollars; loss of right to vote until the completion of the entire felony sentence; loss of the right to carry a gun; and, loss of certain academic and professional opportunities.</p>
<p>Use of illegal drugs is linked to some of the leading causes of death, like homicide, sexual crimes, violence, suicide, HIV infection, hepatitis, pneumonia, mental illness and motor-vehicle injuries. It is because of these other consequences, which put the lives of so many others in danger, why law enforcement officers and the DEA fight the crime with much more intensity. Thus, rather than just charging an individual with possession, law enforcers also look for signs, such as small plastic bags, scales and large amounts of cash, which are all possible signs of intent to sell.</p>
<p>The penalties awaiting a person convicted of a drug crime should never be taken lightly; more so, however, are the effects of a conviction which, according to the website of the <a href="http://www.lomtl.com/">Law Offices of Mark T. Lassiter</a>, can definitely ruin a person’s future even years after his/her conviction and despite having completed the terms of his/her sentence. Because whether he/she likes it or not, his/her crime and conviction will be on record accessible, especially, to potential employers.</p>
<p>Everyone is innocent until proven guilty. Thus, though a person may, indeed, be caught with illegal drugs in his/her possession, he/she is very much entitled to the most competent legal defense available which can help prove that he/she may not really be guilty of a crime after all.</p>

					<h2><a href="http://www.cullmanairport.com/the-pregnant-workers-fairness-act/">The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act</a></h2>
					<br />

			<p>In the spring of 2012, a 16 weeks pregnant woman was rushed to a hospital somewhere in Manhattan. It was discovered by the attending physician at that time that the woman was employed as a cashier in one of the city’s large stores. Despite her doctor’s orders that she drink water frequently due to her condition, her boss did not allow her to do so while she worked at the cash register. Unable to take adequate amounts of fluids, plus the requirement of having to stand for hours at the register, eventually resulted to her fainting, collapsing and suffering from severe dehydration.</p>
<p>Despite Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964’s prohibition of workplace discrimination based on one’s sex or gender and the 1978 Pregnancy Discrimination Act‘s (PDA) outlawing of pregnancy discrimination, many women continue to suffer unfair treatment due to their pregnancy.</p>
<p>The story above is, in fact, just one of the thousands of cases which show discrimination based on pregnancy. While managers would usually consider the plight of disabled employees as an act of compliance with the stipulations of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, giving employees with disabilities lighter or less strenuous jobs, women, who become pregnant and request for temporary reasonable adjustments in their work, are, instead, either sent on a forced leave or are fired immediately.</p>
<p>In the hope of effectively addressing the plight of pregnant employees, the 113th US Congress (2013-2014) proposed the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/942">Pregnant Workers Fairness Act</a>, which declares it unlawful for employers, labor organizations, employment agencies, and other identified entities to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fail to create reasonably acceptable accommodations for women job applicants and employees in view of the limitations temporarily brought about by their pregnancy, childbirth and other related medical conditions unless such accommodation would cause undue hardship in the business operations of that entity</li>
<li>Deny opportunities in employment based on the firm’s need to make such reasonable adjustments or accommodations</li>
<li>Require pregnant employees or job applicants to consent to a job accommodation which they would not want to accept</li>
<li>Require pregnant employees to go on leave when a reasonable accommodation can be provided so as not to compromise their condition</li>
</ul>
<p>The proposed Pregnant Workers Fairness Act also directs the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to make regulations to carry out this Act, as well as identify specific reasonable accommodations that will address the limitations of women (due to their pregnancy, childbirth, or other related medical conditions).</p>
<p>As of April 2015, a total of 14 states and five cities have already passed laws that will require certain employers to provide reasonable accommodations to all their pregnant workers. These states and cities include: Alaska; California; Central Falls, Rhode Island; Connecticut; Delaware; District of Columbia; Hawaii; Illinois; Louisiana; Maryland; Minnesota; Nebraska; New Jersey; New York City, New York; North Dakota; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Providence, Rhode Island; Texas; and, West Virginia.</p>
<p>According to the website of law firm <a href="http://www.carykanelegal.com/practice-area/employment-discrimination-law/">Cary Kane LLP</a>, employers should comply with all federal and state employment laws and make sure that their businesses are free from any form of discriminatory acts. Thus, it is important that those who strongly feel that they are being discriminated upon, most especially pregnant women, should contact a seasoned lawyer immediately for proper investigation of their case and the legal options they are entitled to pursue.</p>

					<h2><a href="http://www.cullmanairport.com/the-benefits-of-a-long-term-disability-insurance-policy/">The Benefits of a Long Term Disability Insurance Policy</a></h2>
					<br />

			<p>Work-related injuries, illnesses and fatal accidents continue to be a major concern of federal, state and local governments due to their high count despite the laws which mandate that all working environments should be kept healthy and safe for all employees.</p>
<p>Records from the US Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics reveal a little more than three million non-fatal workplace injuries and illnesses, and 4,405 deaths in 2013. Despite the substantial difference in the number of deaths compared to the latter part of the 20th century (about 14,000 job-related deaths every year), authorities from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) knows that there is still so much to be done, considering the fact that accidents are almost always results of acts of negligence.</p>
<p>Every time a worker is harmed different issues are brought into the open, including the concerned employer’s compliance with workplace safety laws, and the severity of the injury and the effect it will have on the victim’s personal, professional and financial future.</p>
<p>Some accidents cause no more than minor scratches, while others may be a little more serious and, thus, require days or weeks of bed rest. Some injuries are definitely severe, however, causing <a href="https://www.disability.gov/resource/indiana-long-term-care-insurance-program/">long term disabilities</a> (LTD) that render a worker unable to work for months or even years, taking away his or her capability to earn wages.</p>
<p>Good thing, however, some employers provide their employees with a long term disability (LTD) insurance policy as part of their comprehensive employee benefits package; this is to protect their employees from losing any form of earnings during the long period when their injury or illness will keep them out of work.</p>
<p>The effectivity of a long term disability policy is usually up to 10 years or until the employee reaches the age of 65. An employee can start enjoying the benefits of his/her LTD policy after his/her short term disability insurance benefits, if he/she has one, have ended (the short term disability insurance benefits typically last between three to six months).</p>
<p>Most LTD insurance policies are designed to pay disabled employees about 50 – 70 percent of their salary. The benefits in employer-provide LTD policies, however, are subject to taxes, reducing further what the injured employee would receive. Due to this, there are employees who decide to purchase a personal supplemental long term disability insurance; besides the higher pay, this is also tax exempt.</p>
<p>Despite employees’ eligibility to receive LTD benefits, many applications get denied or are awarded benefits that are below what the policy stipulates. Many insurance providers, obviously, are guilty of avoiding making payments, thus, they do all things possible to deny claims, delay assessment of applications or payment of claims, or pay much lower benefits.</p>
<p>While the website of the <a href="http://www.indianapolissocialsecuritylawyer.com/">Hankey Law Office, P.C.</a>, says that applying for benefits can be a long and difficult process, so would making an appeal to have an application reconsidered. Since an insurance policy is a legal contract, the firm wisely advises the injured employee and his/her family to transact any business with the insurance provider through the help of a legal expert who is adept in the LTD insurance benefits law.</p>

					<h2><a href="http://www.cullmanairport.com/non-exempt-and-non-dischargeable-debts-under-chapter-7-bankruptcy/">Non-Exempt and Non-Dischargeable Debts under Chapter 7 Bankruptcy</a></h2>
					<br />

			<p>Anyone with huge debt, that is unable to pay will possibly go through that nerve-racking experience of being hounded and harassed by creditors or debt-collectors until he or she makes a forced decision to pay what he or she owes.</p>
<p>Loss of job, reduction in income, an unexpected health problem that requires costly medical treatment, divorce, a natural calamity, etc., are just some of the reasons for people’s sudden inability to pay a mortgage, a car loan and other debts. But the more payments missed only results to the cost of the debt piling up until it reaches an amount that is already quite impossible for the borrower to still settle.</p>
<p>Can a borrower still save himself or herself from his or her seemingly impossible-to-pay overwhelming debts? A “No” will definitely be devastating; fortunately, however, the answer is “Yes,” and the means is a legal one even – Bankruptcy.</p>
<p>In 2010, an estimated 1.53 million Americans filed bankruptcy in various U.S. federal bankruptcy courts. According to the website of <a href="http://www.greenwaybankruptcy.com/">Greenway Bankruptcy Law, LLC</a>, bankruptcy is a legal procedure wherein a person (or a business) declares inability to make further payments in settlement of his or her debts. It has been allowed by the law to give people (or firms) a fresh start in their financial lives.</p>
<p>In every concern there is a bankruptcy chapter that would be the appropriate solution. <a href="http://www.uscourts.gov/services-forms/bankruptcy/bankruptcy-basics/chapter-7-bankruptcy-basics">Chapter 7 Bankruptcy</a> or liquidation bankruptcy, for instance, is one that requires a debtor to surrender to a court-appointed trustee his or her “non-exempt” assets and properties for liquidation. One task of the trustee is to sell these properties in order to raise the amount needed in paying off the borrower’s creditors. Payment will only be on debts that are non- dischargeable; these include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlisted debts and creditors</li>
<li>Most student loans, unless paying these would cause “undue hardship” to the borrower and/or his or her dependents</li>
<li>Federal, state, and local taxes which are no more than three years old from the time these first became due</li>
<li>Court fees</li>
<li>Government-imposed penalties, fines, and restitution</li>
<li>Child support and alimony or spousal support</li>
<li>Debts resulting from wrongful death or personal injury damages if these are consequences of DUI</li>
</ul>
<p>Dischargeable debts, on the other hand, include personal loans, credit card loans, medical bills, past utility bills, etc.; the debtor is freed from these debts by the court.</p>

			<p>Being offered a car ride to your destination is definitely great convenience, but being able to drive your own can is nothing less than traveling freedom.</p>
<p>A car is the most common means of transport for Americans today. Regardless of destination, millions of individuals take to the road every day, never mindful of fuel cost, traffic, or the danger of a possible road accident.</p>
<p>The website of the <a href="http://www.woodsonlawfirm.com/">Woodson Law Firm</a> confirms the fact that a car, rather than a luxury, is now a necessity for many people. The convenience it offers, though, the firm continues, is also faced with commensurate danger due to the recklessness or negligence of a lot of drivers and other persons concerned, including vehicle manufacturers and those tasked to keep roads and highways driving-hazard free. The so many motor vehicle accidents every year, which injure more than 2 million individuals and take the lives of more than 30,000 others, are the clear results of these careless behaviors.</p>
<p>Drunk driving, reckless driving, overspeeding (or even driving way below the speed limit), driver error, distracted driving, which includes <a href="http://www.distraction.gov/">cell phone use</a>, highway defects, and car or car part defect, are the reasons for the millions of preventable accidents all across the US, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.</p>
<p>Car accidents do not only result to physical injuries and property damages. These entail other consequences that may possibly alter the life of victims and their families, especially if the injury leads to permanent disability or death. While non-fatal accidents, whether minor or severe, would require medical treatment (which can be costly), loss of income, or (if disabling) loss of the capability to continue work or find employment, an untimely death can put the victim’s family into financial trouble, especially if the victim is the head of, or bread-winner in, the family.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.seegmillerpersonalinjury.com/san-bernardino-county/">Seegmiller Law Firm</a> explains on its website the right of victims or their families to file a civil lawsuit against the liable negligent party for the possibility of recovering compensation from them, for the damages resulting from, and may still result from, the injury. Preparing all necessary documents relating to the accident and the injury, proving the accused party’s negligent or reckless behavior, and filing the lawsuit within the given statutory limit, can all be too much worry and complex for the victim. Thus, having a <a href="http://killeen.withviclegal.com/">Killeen personal injury attorney</a> could be a wise decision.</p>

			<p>In 1994 the US <a href="http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/ucm175826.htm">Food and Drug Administration</a> approved the use of Risperdal for patients suffering from schizophrenia and bipolar disorders. This anti-psychotic drug from Janssen-Cilag, a subsidiary of Johnson &amp; Johnson, though, wasn’t just any kind of drug. First, it was claimed safe by its developer and, second, was proven effective by doctors and by those who used it. Thus, it eventually gained acceptance, so that, by the latter part of 2011, 23% of the more than 54 million antipsychotic drugs prescribed to the millions of Americans, who were battling against schizophrenia or the symptoms of bipolar disorder, was Risperdal.</p>
<p>Risperdal’s other brand names are Risperdal M-Tab and Risperdal Consta, while, generically, it is known as Risperidone. This drug is said to cause interference in the communication process of the brain nerves, thus, affecting brain functions. Specifically, Risperdal is formulated to block nerve receptors, to which the brain’s neurotransmitters attach themselves. By doing this, the drug is able to alter any incidence of abnormal brain communication, which is the cause of psychotic illness.</p>
<p>It may probably be considered as one of the greatest dangers that befall claimed safe and effective prescription drugs, which is these being recommended for non-label use, that is for an illness other than that approved by the FDA. To this danger Risperdal was not exempt as doctors also began prescribing the drug to treat obsessive-compulsive disorders, stuttering, attention deficit disorder (ADD) in children, behavioral disorders in elders suffering from dementia, depression, anxiety and Tourette syndrome (a neurological illness characterized by involuntary vocalizations, tics and tan incontrollable utterance of obscenities).</p>
<p>That Risperdal really worked is one thing that cannot be denied, but so are the claims of complications and side-effects due to its use. In fact, years before it earned wide acceptance in 2011 there were already reports (of its prolonged use) as causing gynecomastia in male children and adolescents (gynecomastia is the enlargement or development of breasts; solution to this traumatic male condition can be liposuction or mastectomy, the surgical procedure for the removal of a breast); on this case alone, as many as 130 were reported in 2006.</p>
<p>There are many other complications linked to the use of Risperdal. According to the website of law firm <a href="http://www.williamskherkher.com/">Williams Kherkher</a>, these complications can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sexual dysfunction</li>
<li>Suicide or suicidal thoughts</li>
<li>Hyperglycemia or high blood sugar</li>
<li>Pancreatitis (or inflammation of the pancreas)</li>
<li>Bone loss</li>
<li>Pituitary tumors (the abnormal growth of cells in the pituitary gland)</li>
<li>Galactorrhea (inappropriate or excessive production of milk)</li>
<li>Arrhythmia (irregular or abnormal heart beat)</li>
<li>Neuroleptic malignant syndrome or NMS (a deadly neurological disorder that is caused by an adverse reaction to antipsychotic drugs</li>
<li>Increased death rate in the elderly suffering from dementia</li>
<li>Heart attack</li>
</ul>
<p>The health risks resulting from the use of Risperdal could very well be a case of negligence which, according to the website of <a href="http://www.williamskherkher.com/practice-areas/defective-pharmaceuticals/risperdal/">Williams Kherkher</a>, is one of the factors that threatens the safety of many antipsychotic patients in the US. Though no harm may be intended by the drug’s developer Janssen-Cilag, the potentially life-threatening effects it can cause are reasons enough for affected patients to pursue legal action for the possible compensation for their losses.</p>
