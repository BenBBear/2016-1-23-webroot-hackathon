		This site is dedicated to the descendants of Stephen Randall, born in Stonington, CT in 1736 and an early settler of Long Island, NY. <br> 
		<br> 
		Stephen was a fourth generation American.  His great grandfather, John Randall, immigrated to Westerly, Rhode Island from Bath, England in 1667.  He was only two when he and his father settled in Ridge, Long Island.  His descendants, numbering over 1,500 are widely dispersed throughout the country, but their roots lie in Long Island.<br> 
		<br> 
		Please take a few minutes to explore the tidbits of history that we have uncovered so far. <br> 
		<br> 
		It is hoped that this site will serve as a "time capsule" for future generations of Long Island Randalls to examine, enjoy and hopefully continue.
