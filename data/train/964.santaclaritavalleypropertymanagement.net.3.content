<h3 class="auto-style1">No Conflict Policy</h3>
	<h3>Why CoastManagement.net <BR><br>
	Does Not Provide Property Maintenance Services Directly</h3></font>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="justify">CoastManagement.net does not provide maintenance property services 
directly (including landscape maintenance) because we believe that providing 
these services directly creates a conflict of interest with management clients 
which cannot be addressed satisfactorily.<br>
<br>
Management companies have the responsibility (a fiduciary duty) for making 
certain that their clients receive the greatest value possible for every dollar 
spent on property maintenance services. This means the management company must make 
certain that their clients do not pay an excessive billing rate, do not pay for 
an excessive number of hours billed, do not pay for inferior work, do not pay 
for unnecessary work, and that maintenance is scheduled so as to minimize the 
number of service calls in order to minimize your overall cost.<br>
<br>
Companies that provide property maintenance services directly are in business to maximize 
their profit. This legitimate goal is in direct conflict with the property 
owner's goal of minimizing maintenance costs. We believe a management company 
cannot reconcile this conflict of interest if it provides maintenance services 
to its client. For example, it is possible that the need to meet payroll costs 
could influence the management company's judgment as to how much maintenance is 
&quot;necessary&quot; at your building.<br>
<br>
A management company that hires only independent, third party property maintenance 
companies, such as CoastManagement.net has the incentive and ability to fully 
protect property owners without regard to the profitability of the maintenance 
operation. A management company that directly provides maintenance services may 
not have the same incentive or ability.<br>
<br>
By law, a management company, as agent for the owner, has the duty to put your 
interest above its own. CoastManagement.net is in a position to do exactly that. 
We take our responsibility seriously.&nbsp;

Why CoastManagement.net Does Not<BR><BR>Solicit or Accept HOA Management Accounts<BR><BR>from Home Builders - Developers
<BR></font></h2>
	<p>We believe that accepting homeowner association property management accounts from home builders creates a conflict of interest for the management company that cannot be reconciled.<BR><BR>

When a developer hires a management company to manage an association, the management company becomes the agent of the association the minute the first escrow is closed because the association is created at that time.  This means the management company owes its duty of loyalty to the association when the first unit is sold, notwithstanding the fact that it was selected and hired by the developer.  While the management company should know that its duty of loyalty runs in favor of the association, it also knows that it will not receive additional accounts from the developer if it takes sides against it, or points out any failures on the part of the developer.<BR><BR>  

Management companies are well aware of the fact that developer controlled boards are likely to terminate their services and cease future referrals if the management company takes the side of the association against the developer.  Management companies that seek management accounts from developers learn quickly that they are in a difficult position.<BR><BR>

While not all management companies that accept developer referred management accounts breach their duty to the association, homeowners must be alert to the possibility.<BR><BR>

Some of the abuses that we have observed over the last twenty five years includes the following:<BR><BR>

<ul>
<LI>Management company covering up construction defects so that the statue of limitations eliminates the right of the association to make a legal claim against the developer for the cost of repairing construction defects.<BR><BR>
<LI>Management company conveniently ignoring the fact that the developer has not paid its HOA assessments on unsold units.<BR><BR>
<LI>Failing to charge the developer late fees and interest on delinquent assessments.<BR><BR>
<LI>Ignoring the fact that the developer controlled board of directors is using HOA funds to pay for repairs that should have been paid by the developer.<BR><BR>
<LI>Advising the buyers that the developer is responsible for making repairs for only one year when the developer's legal obligation can run from one to as many as ten years after completion depending on the facts.</ul>
	Not every developer is liable for construction defects and breaches its duty to the association, and not every management company hired by a home builder breaches its duty to the association and its members.  However, as a board member, you should be aware of the risks and understand the dangers.

 Deferred Management Fee Program<BR><BR>
For Homeowner Associations<BR></font></h2>
	<div class="auto-style2">
		<font color="#3333cc"><strong>No Management Fees for 5 Years
	</strong>
</font></div>
	</p>
	<p>The deferred management fee program offered by <em>CoastManagement.net</em> is designed for homeowner associations of 4 to 40 units located anywhere in Southern California that are financially challenged, but have the desire and willingness to develop a plan to turn things around. If you have more than 40 units and have an interest in our program, please call us to discuss how Coast may assist you.<BR><BR>

The deferred management fee concept is simple. Coast provides management services and then loans the earned fees back to the association at a low interest rate. Interest does not start to accrue until after five years has elapsed or the management agreement is terminated, whichever first occurs. The association is then given seven years to repay the amount owed. During the period that fees are deferred, the association can use the money to cure deferred maintenance, etc. Coast may also be able to arrange a separate HOA Loan for the association.<BR><BR>

Your association is not locked into a long term agreement. You may terminate the agreement any time after a 60 day written notice is provided.

An example follows:</p>
	<ol>

<li>	Association fee is $490 per month 

<li>	After 5 years, $29,400 is owed to <i>CoastManagement.net</i>. No interest has accrued to this point in time.

<li>	Monthly payments, including interest at 7% now become payable, $443.72 per month for 7 years.

</ol>
	
	<p>California law authorizes the board of directors of an incorporated homeowner association to borrow funds unless the governing documents prohibit borrowing without membership approval.<BR><BR><BR><BR></p>

	<p>Some homeowner association management companies are not interested in providing management services to small homeowner associations because they are viewed as being unprofitable.  These management companies prefer to concentrate on the larger associations.<br><br>

	<em>CoastManagement.net</em> is most definitely interested in providing management services to small associations as well as large associations.<br><br>

Coast is highly organized and efficient at providing management services.  We maximize the use of technology, forms, and standardized procedures for dealing with routine management and maintenance issues.  Consequently, we are able to provide first class service to small associations at a reasonable cost.<br><br>
