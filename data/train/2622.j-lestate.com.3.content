        <span class="column"><div id="accordion"><!--ACCORDION-->
        	<p><strong>For the Occupied Home -</strong> by listening to you, carefully assessing your needs and potentially identifying needs you didn't know existed; we develop customized maintenance programs that are uniquely suited for you.</p>
			<p>We typically perform Property Evaluations twice a week but will do as often as you request. We assess all major systems including but not limited to HVAC, electrical, plumbing and security. We perform Preventive Maintenance in accordance with your customized plan. Depending upon the season this may involve services such as cleaning the chimney, draining the water heater or even creating work specifications for additional tradesmen.</p>
