                   <h2>Monuments of Delhi</h2>
                   <p>&nbsp;</p>
                   <h4>Humayun Tomb</h4>
                   
                   <p><strong>Mughal dynasty, Akbar period, 16th  c.</strong></p>
                   <p>&nbsp;</p>
                   <p>Humayun the second in line of the  Mughal emperors (after Babar) built the second city of Delhi known as Din-panah, which is largely  lost now. His senior widow Hamida Banu Begam, also known as Haji Begum (after  she completed Haj) is credited with the construction of his mausoleum, though  probably her son Akbar must have given inputs. She choose the persian architect  Mirak Mirza Ghiyas, who gave justice to being chosen by designing a tomb with  several innovative features, not seen before in Indian architecture - the  massive proportions and the superb blend of Persian and Indian characteristics.  As Percy Brown describes: it is an &quot;Indian interpretation of a Persian  conception&quot;.</p>
                   <p><img src="Images/index_clip_image002.jpg" alt="Humayun Tomb" width="300" height="193">The double-storied main building  made in red sandstone, is square-shaped with chamfered corners and sits on a  twenty-two feet high terrace. Embellishment is provided by white marble borders  and panels. Each story has three arched alcoves with the central one being the  highest, with perforated screens. The central dome is surrounded by marble  pillared <em>chhatris</em> (kiosks). An  innovative feature is the placement of the main monument in the center of a <em>char-bagh</em> (literally four gardens), a  kind of garden which is divided into four main parts by shallow water-channels  and walkways.&nbsp; Though Sikandar  Lodi's tomb was the first garden-tomb to be built in India, yet the impressiveness of  Humayun's tomb is far better. Setting the vocabulary  of Mughal architecture, it is thought that this tomb formed the model for the  Taj Mahal, which marks the zenith for the Mughal period monuments.<br>
                     <strong>Humayun's tomb is a world heritage monument. </strong><br>
                   (UNESCO's World Heritage List includes 936 properties  forming part of the cultural and natural heritage which the World Heritage  Committee considers as having outstanding universal value. These include 725  cultural , 183 natural&nbsp; and 28 mixed&nbsp; properties in 153 States Parties)</p>
                   <p><strong><em>how to reach</em></strong>:&nbsp; Humayun's tomb is 1/2 km from Maulsari. Just walk  till there. </p>
                   <p>&nbsp;</p>
                   <h4><strong>Lodi dynasty  Monuments, Lodi Garden, New Delhi</strong><br>
                     16th century</h4>
                   <p><br>
                     <strong><img src="Images/index_clip_image002_0000.jpg" alt="Sheesh Gumbad Lodhi Dynasty" width="264" height="179"></strong>Lodi Garden in New Delhi  today is what Central Park is to New Yorkers.  All manner of people from dedicated walkers to people walking their dogs to politicians  with their coterie of gun-wielding security are attracted to its tranquil spaces.  Yoga lessons take place and weekends witness picnicking crowds thronging the  gardens around the several <strong>Lodi</strong><strong> dynasty monuments of 16th century</strong> in the  complex. Quiet sentinels of the past, these monuments impart a serene beauty to  the gardens. Few visitors realize the intrigues and violent power struggles  that are part of their history. </p>
                   <p>The weakest and most inept dynasty in Delhi's history, the Sayyids (1414-51) were overthrown  by the Afghan dynasty of the Lodis (1451-1526). The last of the Lodi rulers, Ibrahim Lodi (r. 1517-26) towards the end of  his rule indulged in ill treating his own nobles and even provincial governors,  incurring their resentment and impelling the governor of Lahore, Daulat Khan to invite Babar to attack  Ibrahim Lodi. Thereupon took place the famous battle at Panipat in 1526, where  Ibrahim Lodi was defeated and killed giving Babar control over Delhi and the  large area of north India which was under the control of Lodis, which ushered  in the 300 hundred years rule of the mighty Mughals.</p>
                   <p>The Sheesh Gumbad in the Lodi Gardens  was decorated with glazed tiles, therefore it was given this name literally  meaning 'dome of glass'. The Bara-Gumbad mosque opposite it was built during  the reign of Sikander Lodi (1489-1517). Its divided into five bays and has  three domes. It is profusely embellished with foliage and inscriptions in  relief carving. </p>
                   <p>Lodi  garden is home to a large variety of colourful birds, sign-boards give the  details. Under the curving bridge is a winding stream which has several white  swans living on its banks. Especially charming are the owls living in the  wood-bores. Autumn has rich clusters of pink and white corezia laden trees, in January  the rose-garden bursts forth with blooms, while in early spring rows of annual  flowers line the walkways. <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  <em><strong>how to reach</strong></em><strong>:</strong> Lodi   Garden is 3 1/2 kms from  Maulsari. Take a taxi or auto-rickshaw (or walk if so inclined) </p>
                   <p><strong><em>Around Lodi garden</em>:</strong> Many  interesting cultural institutions are within 100 metres of Lodi garden.&nbsp; <br>
                     <strong>India International Centre (IIC)</strong>: Cultural  events, lectures and art exhibitions almost everyday.<br>
                     <strong>Alliance</strong><strong> Fran&ccedil;aise de Delhi</strong>: Cultural events  and art exhibitions take place regularly. Has a good cafeteria, reasonably  priced. <br>

                   <p>&nbsp;</p>
                   <h2>Qutab Minar</h2>
                   <p>&nbsp;</p>
                   <p><img src="Images/index_clip_image002_0001.jpg" alt="Qutab Minar" width="141" height="200" align="baseline">The <strong>Qutub Minar</strong> was built in 1206, by Qutub ud-din Aibak (r. 1206-1210) of the Mamluk or Slave  dynasty (1206-1290), as a tower of victory, 'to cast the shadow of God over the  East and over the West' as an inscription on it says. Aibak had to wait several  years to assume the throne of Delhi.  In 1192 C.E., it was his master Muhammad Ghuri who had defeated the valiant  Prithviraj Chauhan in the famous battle of Tarain. Prithviraj was the Rajput  king of the city of Rai Pithora Garh,  of which Lal Kot is a part. Lalkot is the first of the seven cities of Delhi, established by the  Tomar Rajput ruler, Anang Pal, in 1060. Muhammad returned to Ghur leaving in  charge his faithful general Aibak, a turkish slave who he had freed and given  an army career. When Muhammad was murdered in 1206, Aibak declared himself  sultan and established the first muslim dynasty in India. With the ready assistance of  general Khalji, Aibal extended his empire to western and eastern India, among others, destroying the ancient,  Buddhist monastic university   of Nalanda.</p>
                   <p>The tapering 72.5 m. high minar (tower) has five storeys.  Faced with red and buff sandstone, each storey is laid out on a different plan,  the lowest has 24 alternate angular and circular flutings, the second has only  round ones, the third only angular ones, while the fourth and fifth are  cylindrical and faced with white marble. Projecting balconies dividing each  level, are highly decorated with carvings. Lots of exquisitely fine carvings of <em>naskhi</em> (cursive arabic script) inscriptions  interspersed with geometric designs and flowers and leaves motifs decorate the  tower. Earlier it was good fun to climb up huffing all the way to the top of  the tower from the circular staircase inside, and enjoy a panoramic view of Delhi, but now it has  been closed. Qutub Minar complex was built on the site of 27 Hindu temples  which were destroyed and their carved idols, stone members and pillars defaced  and used for the buildings. A Ganesh idol has been reinstated and people offer  obeisance today. </p>
                   <p>An iron pillar of the 4th century Gupta period, about 7 m in  height, stands in the courtyard of the mosque next to the Minar, strangely at  variance with the other Islamic structures. The pillar made of 98% pure iron  bears Sanskrit inscriptions and is extraordinary by virtue of being almost free  of rust, posing a brainteaser to metallurgists. Possible explanations are that  it was made of wrought-iron pieces which are resistanct to corrosion, also the  climatic conditions of Delhi  and probably it must have been frequently anointed with ghee. Maybe it was  surmounted with a Garuda figure, but it no longer exists. Legend said that if  one wanted one's wish granted, it could be achieved by standing with your back  to the pillar and joining your hands behind it. However this is not possible  now as a fence has been erected around the pillar in to prevent damage.</p>
                   <p>&nbsp;Aibak's successor and  son-in-law Iltutmish (r. 1211-36) completed the building of Qutub Minar. Iltutmish  nominated his courageous daughter Razia Begum (r. 1236-1240) as his successor,  the only woman Sultan to ascend the throne of Delhi, who died after only four years of  rule. <br>
                     <strong>Qutub Minar is a  world heritage monument. </strong><br>
                     (UNESCO's World Heritage List includes 936 properties  forming part of the cultural and natural heritage which the World Heritage  Committee considers as having outstanding universal value. These include 725  cultural , 183 natural&nbsp; and 28 mixed&nbsp; properties in 153 States Parties)<br>
  <strong><em>how to reach</em></strong>: Qutub Minar is located in the Mehrauli area, 13 kms.  from Maulsari. The yellow metro line from Jor Bagh station will take 15 minutes  to reach. In the winter season, Delhi Tourism organizes cultural programmes in  the gardens with the Minar as a beautiful backdrop. </p>
