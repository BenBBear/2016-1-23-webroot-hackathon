<p>Nothing like political posturing to make things more bumpy.</p>
<blockquote class="curated_content"><p>U.S. Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., speaks at a press conference Wednesday on Republican plans to delay enactment of the Affordable Care Act. Looking on are Sens. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., John Barrasso, R-Wyo., and John Cornyn, R-Texas.</p>
<p>Sensing that recent delays in key portions of the Affordable Care Act have caught the Obama administration at a weak point in its rollout of the law, Republicans in Congress are doubling down on their efforts to cripple the measure, at least in the eyes of the public if not in fact.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rather than a partial delay for some, America needs a permanent delay for all,&#8221; said Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., at a news conference Wednesday on Capitol Hill. Thune got 45 other GOP senators to sign onto a letter to the president urging him to shelve the law entirely.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s becoming ever more clear that the Affordable Care Act, ObamaCare, fails to accomplish its intended purposes,&#8221; said Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kan., at the press conference.</p>
<p>Moran said hat he would be offering amendments to try to block key aspects of the law during Thursday&#8217;s Committee on Appropriations markup on funding for the Department of Health and Human Services. His amendments include one that would bar funding to enforce the individual mandate, requiring people to get health insurance or pay a fine.</p></blockquote>
<p>It looks like the Affordable Care Act will be contested until the bitter end.</p>

<p>Someone needs to get the word out.</p>
<blockquote class="curated_content"><p>Despite the fact that Obamacare has been in place for over three years at this point, a lot of Americans still remain confused about the specific nature of the health reform law. Last month, a Kaiser Health poll revealed that many Americans still can’t correctly identify Obamacare’s provisions. Now, Kaiser’s most recent polling finds that 42 percent of Americans aren’t sure about whether Obamacare is law at all. Seven percent of survey respondents believed the Supreme Court overturned it, and 12 percent thought Congress had repealed it:</p>
<p>Of course, now that Obamacare has survived a Supreme Court challenge, dozens of repeal efforts, and a presidential election, even Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) has admitted that it’s the “law of the land.” Nonetheless, as administration officials prepare for the full implementation of the law and ready the state-level insurance markets to open in 2014, they still have a long way to go when it comes to fully educating the American public about it.</p>
<p>Kaiser found that Americans’ education gaps fall along class lines, as wealthier Americans are more likely to have heard something about health care reform from newspapers, radio, or online sources. Just 30 percent of those with lower incomes reported that they had received information about Obamacare from those sources. That’s especially problematic because many low-income Americans stand to significantly benefit from the health law, as they will become eligible for federal assistance to help them afford insurance coverage on the state marketplaces. Still, 58 percent of uninsured Americans and 56 percent of low-income Americans told Kaiser that they don’t know how Obamacare will impact their lives.</p></blockquote>
<p>This makes us wonder how smooth this will workout with Open Enrollment not far off.

<p>Getting the word out.</p>
<blockquote class="curated_content"><p>October is also a big month for the Obama administration.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s when millions of Americans can start signing up for new health insurance policies through health exchanges established in each state under the Affordable Care Act.</p>
<p>Polls show most Americans still don&#8217;t understand how they&#8217;re supposed to do it. The White House and its state partners are eager to let them know. They&#8217;re trying to recruit baseball teams and other sports franchises to help.</p>
<p>It worked before.</p>
<p>Back in 2007, the Boston Red Sox won the World Series, sweeping the Colorado Rockies in four games. It&#8217;s also the year that Massachusetts started requiring nearly all residents to have health insurance &#8212; and the Red Sox helped to get the word out about it.</p>
<p>The team let the state set up booths at games to explain the new law to fans, and the Massachusetts Health Connector ran ads during Red Sox oadcasts.</p>
<p>Red Sox fan Amy O&#8217;Leary remembers it well. &#8220;I think it made sense. People feel like they know the players,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I think that sports teams in general can be messengers of good information to a wide variety of people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now that other states are opening health insurance marketplaces, they&#8217;re trying the same strategy.</p>
<p>&#8220;People who care about being healthy, our young adult population, are big watchers of the sports shows, and we know [they] are going to be an important population for us to reach,&#8221; says Myung Kim, outreach director for Colorado&#8217;s health insurance exchange.</p>
<p>Colorado is focusing on young people because a lot of them are uninsured. And for the Affordable Care Act to work, they need to buy into the system. Young people who probably won&#8217;t use much health care are expected to balance out older, sicker people who will.</p>
<p>So the state is running television ads during Rockies baseball games that show people buying a health policy and then celebrating as if they&#8217;d just won a sporting event. The voice-over in the ads says, &#8220;Connect for Health Colorado, because when health insurance companies compete, there&#8217;s only one winner: You.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Its good to know they will be getting the word out because a high percentage of Americans still do not know it is the law of the land.</p>

<p>Will Multi-State Health Plans spark competition?</p>
<blockquote class="curated_content"><p>A program meant to beef up competition on Obamacare exchanges may not add much to the mix of insurance options after all.</p>
<p>The Multi-State Plan Program — which was the closest thing to a watered-down “public option” that made it into the final health law — is eventually supposed to provide at least two new insurance options in every state.</p>
<p>The problem is that the only insurers likely to be able to quickly scale up coverage across the country are already doing just that: selling their plans from coast to coast.</p>
<p>The Affordable Care Act calls for the federal government to contract with two multistate plans — and one has to be a nonprofit. They have to be available in at least 31 states next year, although they don’t necessarily have to be available in every community in a state at the outset. Within four years, they have to be available nationwide. Having failed to get a government-run public option, backers wanted at least one nationwide, nonprofit alternative to compete with the standard commercial plans.</p>
<p>So far, only Blue Cross Blue Shield has publicly declared that it will offer multistate plans. But the Blues already provide coverage in all 50 states, and the early indications are that their multistate plans will basically be clones of the standard plans they’ll be selling anyway in any given state. That means consumers won’t really be getting anything new.</p>
<p>“For all practical purposes, the [multistate] plan in Kansas is the same as the one they submitted to be their regular plan for the regular marketplace,” said Linda Sheppard, health policy director in the Kansas Department of Insurance. “I think for our state, it doesn’t really offer another option.”</p>
<p>Kansas has two Blue Cross insurers. One is in the Kansas City area, and the other covers the other 103 counties. And it’s that second one offering the multistate plan — in the same same 103 counties, Sheppard said.</p>
<p>The Office of Personnel Management, which administers federal employee health insurance across the country, must sign off on multistate plans before they can be offered on the new insurance marketplaces known as exchanges. It has yet to officially do so.</p>
<p>OPM declined to comment, other than to say that it was still reviewing more than 200 plan applications — they were due in late March — and will release more information after it contracts with insurers. But there are clear signs that one of the slots is for the Blues.</p>
<p>At least five states have publicly said that multistate plans will be offered on their exchanges next year — Arkansas, Kansas, Maryland, Michigan and Montana. All except Maryland have identified Blue Cross affiliates as the sponsors.</p></blockquote>
<p>Do you see a lot of competition when the competitors are the same company?</p>

<p>The following article just shows how complex the Affordable Care Act is going to be to implement.</p>
<blockquote class="curated_content"><p>This story first appeared in the July 19 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.</p>
<p>Three letters have been giving the payroll-services industry fits for several months now: ACA. That&#8217;s the semi-acronym for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare, and it&#8217;s up to the payroll industry &#8212; which cuts checks to production workers and offers related financial services to TV and film studios &#8212; to help educate its clients on the rules before a good portion of the law kicks in Jan. 1.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a morass of regulations and requirements, and everyone&#8217;s trying to figure out what their exposure is,&#8221; says Eric Belcher, president and CEO of Cast &amp; Crew Entertainment Services. Adds Mark Goldstein, CEO of Entertainment Partners, which has held 16 seminars to help studios understand ACA: &#8220;It&#8217;s going to be a very big deal.&#8221;</p>
<p>Determining the exact nature of the new laws has been difficult, given that many ACA terms have yet to be worked out. Hollywood productions, for instance, might find it irksome simply trying to categorize employees as full- or part-time, seasonal or variable, and it&#8217;s important that they get the classifications right lest they face hefty fines. &#8220;ACA is thousands of pages, and it wasn&#8217;t written with this industry in mind,&#8221; says Belcher.</p>
<p>One of the unintended consequences, say some industry insiders, is that it could lead to productions running to foreign countries, given that ACA doesn&#8217;t apply to U.S. citizens working aoad. Some also say the number of production days in the U.S. are likely to be cut due to ACA because there&#8217;s a 90-day waiting period before productions must either pay a penalty or offer health insurance to full-time workers. That rule provides big incentives for a production to wrap in less than three months. While big-budget movies and season-long TV shows might not have such a luxury, smaller films or TV pilots could easily rush their schedules to make sure they come in at under 90 days.</p>
<p>But like much about ACA, the 90-day rule is subject to interpretation, says Daniel Cox, controller of payroll-services company PES Payroll. &#8220;Historically, if an employer had a 90-day wait period,&#8221; says Cox, &#8220;the benefits would kick in on the first day of the fourth full month of employment. Thus, that 90-day wait period was, in reality, as long as 119 days. The ACA is unclear on this. Does 90 days mean 90 days? If so, it really means 60 days.&#8221;</p>
<p>In order to dial down the frustration level, the major payroll-services companies are hiring outside tax, legal and benefits consultants &#8212; Cast &amp; Crew has engaged Henehan Co., for example &#8212; and are setting meetings with production clients. Payroll firm Entertainment Partners has authored a 39-page report that includes 81 frequently asked questions. FAQ No. 7, for example, contains the seven steps to determine whether or not a production employs 50 full-time workers, which would trigger an &#8220;employer mandate&#8221; for health coverage. In a nutshell, if you&#8217;ve got about 40 employees who work 130 hours a month and an additional 20 who work 65 hours monthly, you&#8217;re probably subject to the mandate.</p>
<p>Payroll can represent as much as 45 percent of a production&#8217;s cost, and payroll-services companies are still crunching the numbers to figure out how much ACA could add to the budget of a typical production. While the administrative costs might rise a bit for the payroll companies, the costs of extra health coverage or penalties fall to the production companies. Nonunion productions might be hit hardest because workers aren&#8217;t already covered, but even union shoots typically employ many nonunion workers who might need health coverage under ACA.</p>
<p>The mandate dictates that full-time employees be offered insurance that is &#8220;affordable,&#8221; defined as not more than 9.5 percent of an employee&#8217;s household income. The insurance must also be &#8220;adequate,&#8221; meaning it covers at least 60 percent of health care costs incurred. Also, Cox says, &#8220;no more discrimination among employee levels, no more negotiated benefits,&#8221; so if a production pays $1,000 a month to subsidize insurance for a top production worker, it must pay that much for its lowest employees as well. If a production deems it too costly to meet the guidelines, it can opt instead to pay a penalty tax of $166.67 per month for each full-time employee, with the exception of the first 30 of them. In some cases, &#8220;the penalty option may be the cheaper alternative,&#8221; says the Entertainment Partners report.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do I expect the cost of doing business to go up? Yes, I do,&#8221; says Mike Rose, CEO of Ease Entertainment Services.</p>
<p>Rose, though, doesn&#8217;t expect studios to follow the route taken by Regal Entertainment Group, which operates the nation&#8217;s largest chain of movie theaters. In order to rein in the costs of supplying health benefits associated with ACA, Regal said in April it would cut the hours of some employees so that they aren&#8217;t classified &#8220;full-time.&#8221; Productions on tight schedules and in need of highly skilled workers and artists, though, don&#8217;t usually have the luxury of micromanaging an employee&#8217;s hours, says Rose.</p>
<p>&#8220;The ACA is on everybody&#8217;s lips,&#8221; says Cox. &#8220;The only way to gear up for the ACA is to build the tools.&#8221; That means creating charts to determine whether clients are governed by the ACA and what the economic ramifications of electing not to offer insurance will be.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our clients need to know that the days of 100 percent employer-paid benefits at a certain executive level can no longer exist,&#8221; Cox adds. &#8220;Their employees will need tools to navigate the state-sponsored insurance exchanges. In short, we have had to build a toolbox that accommodates our incredibly diverse client base.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This is just one industry and we have already heard about how the restaurant industry will be capping hours worked.  We will see as the Affordable Care Act is interpreted &#8216;on the fly&#8217; how this will all work out in the long run.</p>
