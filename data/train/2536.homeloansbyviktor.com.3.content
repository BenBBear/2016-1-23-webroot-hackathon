<h3>Welcome to my website!</h3>
</p>
<p>Helping families realize the dream of homeownership is my passion. Over the years, I have been able to assist many families obtain financing, many of them for the first time, and it never gets old. To me, it&#39;s always been more than a job. The satisfaction and pride I feel each time one of my Borrowers becomes a Homeowner is indescribable. Each one is an emotional investment for me as every Borrower is more than just a loan, they are friends, neighbors&nbsp;&amp; my community.</p>

<p>My extensive experience as a Loan Officer and knowledge of the industry allows me to tailor each loan to meet the specific needs of each individual. Everyone&rsquo;s story is different, so no one loan will fit everyone&rsquo;s needs. My job is to find that perfect fit. Buying a home is the single most important investment we make. Although it can seem intimidating, I am dedicated to making the process a positive and rewarding experience for you, and I welcome the opportunity to earn your business and your trust.</p>

<p>As a Realtor, I&apos;ve personally worked with many, many loan officers and lenders in the Savannah area. Starkey has always lived up to their promises of great rates and customers service. Though Vik, in particular, is my number one preferred loan officer for several reasons. He has had a personal touch with each and every one of the clients I&apos;ve referred, and I know that they&apos;re being treated and served in the best possible manner. When you make the wise decision to work with Vik, you never have to worry about "the ball being dropped," and he&apos;s there to walk you through every step of the loan process, from pre-qualification to closing. </p>							</blockquote>

When it looked as if things might not go my way he encouraged me not to worry and kept an upbeat attitude that reflected on myself.

<p>Vik was professional, knowledgeable, and friendly. He explained the loan process, walked us through the tedium of gathering appropriate paper work, and answered all our questions. He responded quickly when we called, and he seemed genuinely concerned that we have a positive experience. We would recommend him and Starkey Mortgage to anyone seeking a mortgage in Savannah. </p>							</blockquote>

<p>I am a Realtor and I came to know Vik through a mutual client we shared on a transaction. I was blown away by Vik&apos;s professionalism and level of customer service. Vik was well versed in mortgage products that are not often used, but are very beneficial to consumers. I have done many transactions with Vik and he is very knowledgeable with VA loans, FHA loans, the HUD process, Dream Maker, Georgia Dream and numerous conventional products. Vik&apos;s company is the preferred lender for many big local companies and home builders, like Gulfstream for example. Vik stands out from other mortgage lenders in several ways. The most important thing to Vik is the client. I have watched him counsel buyers who could not initially qualify for a loan. I&apos;ve seen Vik work with a buyer for month and months until they were able to realize the dream of home ownership. Most lenders do not do that! Vik and his company have helped my clients push through closings on extremely tight deadlines. There have been occasions where Vik wasn&apos;t able to help a client in a certain situation, but found someone who could instead of just turning them away. I can&apos;t express enough what a joy it is to work with Vik. He has earned his position on my A-Team as my primary lender. I know that anyone I put in touch with Vik, is in the best hands possible. If you are buyer or thinking of refinancing, Viktor Sasser needs to be your lender. If you are a Realtor and need a mortgage lender that is responsive, proactive, and that you can get in touch with when you need him, Vik is your guy. I recommend that if you are a business, you consider setting up a meeting with Vik Sasser so that he can teach you about the benefits that are available to you and the employees at your company by selecting him as your preferred mortgage lender. One last thing worth a mention, Vik is involved with the community--which I think is so important. If you have a 501 c 3, there are charitable benefits available to your organization if Vik Sasser is your preferred lender. I would recommend Vik to my business associates, closest family and friends, and will use him personally on my next transaction.</p>							</blockquote>

<p>I had worked with Vik in the past in another industry so based on my positive past experience with him, I sought him out when I was looking to refinance my existing mortgage. He and his team were quick to return phone calls and answer questions. I had a good idea of what I wanted and Vik didn&apos;t put any pressure on me to do something else. He kept me updated on the status of my application and we closed in a reasonable amount of time. I would recommend Vik without reservation. </p>							</blockquote>

He explained every detail and answered every question. Although we were hours away he was never more than a phone call away. Led by his guidance we were able to close on time and without any problems. He truly made the home buying experience a pleasant experience. We highly recommend him to everyone looking to buy a home. </p>							</blockquote>

						<div class="testimonial-message">
							<p>I am a Realtor and I came to know Vik through a mutual client we shared on a transaction. I was blown away by Vik&apos;s professionalism and level of customer service. Vik was well versed in mortgage products that are not often used, but are very beneficial to consumers. I have done many transactions with Vik and he is very knowledgeable with VA loans, FHA loans, the HUD process, Dream Maker, Georgia Dream and numerous conventional products. Vik&apos;s company is the preferred lender for many big local companies and home builders, like Gulfstream for example. Vik stands out from other mortgage lenders in several ways. The most important thing to Vik is the client. I have watched him counsel buyers who could not initially qualify for a loan. I&apos;ve seen Vik work with a buyer for month and months until they were able to realize the dream of home ownership. Most lenders do not do that! Vik and his company have helped my clients push through closings on extremely tight deadlines. There have been occasions where Vik wasn&apos;t able to help a client in a certain situation, but found someone who could instead of just turning them away. I can&apos;t express enough what a joy it is to work with Vik. He has earned his position on my A-Team as my primary lender. I know that anyone I put in touch with Vik, is in the best hands possible. If you are buyer or thinking of refinancing, Viktor Sasser needs to be your lender. If you are a Realtor and need a mortgage lender that is responsive, proactive, and that you can get in touch with when you need him, Vik is your guy. I recommend that if you are a business, you consider setting up a meeting with Vik Sasser so that he can teach you about the benefits that are available to you and the employees at your company by selecting him as your preferred mortgage lender. One last thing worth a mention, Vik is involved with the community--which I think is so important. If you have a 501 c 3, there are charitable benefits available to your organization if Vik Sasser is your preferred lender. I would recommend Vik to my business associates, closest family and friends, and will use him personally on my next transaction.</p>

							<p>We came to Vik with a crazy deadline and premature notions. He enlightened us to all of our mortgage options and helped us in choosing the best possible option for our family. He explained every detail and answered every question. Although we were hours away he was never more than a phone call away. Led by his guidance we were able to close on time and without any problems. He truly made the home buying experience a pleasant experience. We highly recommend him to everyone looking to buy a home. </p>

							<p>I had worked with Vik in the past in another industry so based on my positive past experience with him, I sought him out when I was looking to refinance my existing mortgage. He and his team were quick to return phone calls and answer questions. I had a good idea of what I wanted and Vik didn&apos;t put any pressure on me to do something else. He kept me updated on the status of my application and we closed in a reasonable amount of time. I would recommend Vik without reservation. </p>
